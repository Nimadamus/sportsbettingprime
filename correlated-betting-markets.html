        <h1>Correlated Betting Markets: How Sides, Totals, and Props Are Connected</h1>
        <p class="lead">Every betting market on a single sporting event is mathematically related to every other market on that same event. The spread, the total, the moneyline, team totals, player props, and alternate lines all derive from the same underlying event. Understanding these correlations, how they work, when they hold, and when they break, is essential to understanding how sports betting markets function as an interconnected system.</p>

        <h2 id="what-are-correlated">1. What Are Correlated Markets?</h2>

        <p>In statistics, two variables are correlated when a change in one is associated with a predictable change in the other. In sports betting, correlated markets are different bet types on the same event whose outcomes are linked by the underlying structure of that event. They are not independent coin flips; they are different lenses on the same underlying reality.</p>

        <p>The most fundamental correlation in sports betting is between the three core markets: the point spread (or handicap), the moneyline (or match result), and the total (over/under). These three markets all attempt to describe the same game, but from different angles. The spread describes the expected margin of victory. The moneyline describes the probability of each team winning outright. The total describes the expected combined score. Because all three are forecasting aspects of the same event, they must be mathematically consistent with one another, or an inconsistency (a mispricing) exists.</p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <h4>Key Concept: The Shared Probability Distribution</h4>
            <p>All markets on a single game are derived from one underlying probability distribution: the distribution of all possible final scores. If a model predicts that a game's most likely final score distribution centers around a 27-20 outcome, then the spread (approximately -7), the total (approximately 47), the moneyline (reflecting the probability that the favorite's score exceeds the underdog's), and every other derivative market must all be consistent with that same distribution. When one market moves, it should, in theory, trigger corresponding adjustments in all related markets because the underlying distribution has changed.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The concept of correlation extends beyond the three core markets. Team totals (how many points each team scores individually), player props (how a specific player performs), half-time and quarter-time markets, and alternate lines all derive from the same event and are therefore correlated with one another and with the core markets. The further a derivative market is from the core, the weaker and more complex the correlation tends to be, but the mathematical connection is always present.</p>

        <p>Understanding these correlations matters because they reveal how the betting market functions as a system. A sportsbook is not pricing dozens of independent markets; it is pricing dozens of interconnected markets that must remain internally consistent. When they fail to maintain this consistency, it creates structural anomalies that illuminate how market pricing actually works.</p>

        <h2 id="spread-moneyline">2. The Spread-Moneyline Relationship</h2>

        <p>The spread and the moneyline are two expressions of the same forecast: which team will win and by how much. The spread directly states the expected margin of victory, while the moneyline expresses the probability of each team winning outright. These two markets are tightly correlated, and the mathematical relationship between them is well understood.</p>

        <h3>How the Conversion Works</h3>

        <p>The connection between spread and moneyline is mediated by the distribution of scoring margins. In the NFL, for example, a 3-point favorite wins outright approximately 59-60% of the time, while a 7-point favorite wins outright approximately 75-77% of the time. These conversion rates are empirically derived from decades of game results. The moneyline odds should reflect these win probabilities, adjusted for the sportsbook's vig.</p>

        <p>The relationship is not perfectly linear. Moving from a 1-point favorite to a 3-point favorite has a different impact on win probability than moving from a 7-point favorite to a 9-point favorite. This is because scoring margins in sports are not uniformly distributed; they cluster around certain key numbers. In the NFL, margins of 3 and 7 are disproportionately common, which means that crossing these numbers in the spread has a larger-than-linear impact on the corresponding moneyline.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: Spread-to-Moneyline Conversion in the NFL</h4>
            <p>A team favored by 3 points wins outright roughly 59.5% of the time based on historical NFL data. This implies a fair moneyline of approximately -147 for the favorite and +147 for the underdog. After the sportsbook adds vig, the listed moneyline might be -155/+135. Now suppose the spread moves from -3 to -3.5. The favorite's win probability increases modestly (to perhaps 60.5%), which translates to a moneyline of approximately -153 fair value. The moneyline should move correspondingly. If the spread moves but the moneyline does not adjust, the two markets are temporarily inconsistent.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Sport-Specific Conversion Dynamics</h3>

        <p>The spread-moneyline relationship varies by sport because scoring distributions differ. In the NBA, where games are high-scoring and margins of victory are more evenly distributed, the conversion is smoother. A 5-point NBA favorite wins outright approximately 68-70% of the time. In the NHL, where most games are decided by 1-2 goals and overtime is common, a 1.5-goal favorite (the standard puck line) might win outright around 60-65% of the time, but covering the -1.5 puck line occurs less than 50% of the time for all but the most lopsided matchups. In soccer, the three-way moneyline (home/draw/away) adds complexity because the draw outcome must be accounted for, making the spread-moneyline relationship more intricate than in two-outcome sports.</p>

        <h2 id="spread-total">3. The Spread-Total Connection</h2>

        <p>The relationship between the spread (which team wins, and by how much) and the total (how many combined points/goals are scored) is one of the most important correlations in sports betting. These two markets are connected through the underlying score distribution, but the nature of their correlation is more complex than the spread-moneyline relationship.</p>

        <h3>Positive Correlation: Favorites and Overs</h3>

        <p>In general, there is a positive correlation between the favorite winning by a large margin and the game going over the total. The reasoning is intuitive: for a favorite to cover a large spread, they typically need to score a lot of points. While a dominant defensive performance (favorite wins 13-3) could also cover, the most common path to covering a large spread is through offensive production, which pushes the combined score higher.</p>

        <p>This correlation is not symmetrical. The underdog covering (or winning outright) has a more complex relationship with the total. An underdog can cover by keeping the game close, which might lead to an under (low-scoring defensive battle) or an over (high-scoring shootout where the underdog keeps pace). The path an underdog takes to covering the spread is less predictable in its scoring implications than the path a favorite takes.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: Spread-Total Correlation in an NFL Game</h4>
            <p>Consider a game with a spread of -7 and a total of 44. If the favored team wins 31-17 (covering the spread by 7 points), the combined score is 48, over the total. If the favored team wins 17-10 (covering the spread by exactly 7), the combined score is 27, well under the total. Both outcomes cover the spread, but they have opposite effects on the total. The correlation between "favorite covers" and "over hits" is positive but moderate, not deterministic. This is why sportsbooks generally allow same-game parlays combining spread and total, because the correlation, while real, is not strong enough to represent a guaranteed combination.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Mathematical Structure</h3>

        <p>The spread and total are related through team totals. If Team A is favored by 7 in a game with a total of 47, the implied team totals are approximately Team A: 27, Team B: 20. These individual team scoring expectations must sum to the game total (27 + 20 = 47), and the difference between them must approximately equal the spread (27 - 20 = 7). This creates a system of equations that constrains how the spread and total can move relative to one another.</p>

        <p>When the spread changes without the total changing, it implies that one team's expected scoring has increased while the other's has decreased by the same amount. For example, if the spread moves from -7 to -9 while the total remains at 47, the implied team totals shift to approximately 28 and 19. The favorite is now expected to score one more point, and the underdog one fewer, but the combined expectation is unchanged.</p>

        <p>When the total changes without the spread changing, it implies that both teams' expected scoring has shifted in the same direction by the same amount. If the total moves from 47 to 49 while the spread stays at -7, the implied team totals shift to approximately 28 and 21. Both teams are expected to score one more point, but the expected margin remains the same.</p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <h4>Key Concept: The Team Total Equations</h4>
            <p>For any game, the following relationships hold approximately: Team A Expected Score = (Total + Spread) / 2 and Team B Expected Score = (Total - Spread) / 2, where the spread is expressed as a positive number for the favorite. This means that the game total and the spread together implicitly define each team's expected scoring output. Any movement in either the spread or the total therefore has implications for the team totals, and vice versa.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="team-totals">4. Team Totals: The Bridge Between Sides and Totals</h2>

        <p>Team totals are among the most revealing markets in a sportsbook's offering because they sit at the intersection of the side (spread/moneyline) and the total (over/under). A team total is the expected number of points, runs, or goals that a single team will score. It is derived from the game total and the spread, and it must be consistent with both.</p>

        <h3>Deriving Team Totals</h3>

        <p>As established in the previous section, team totals can be derived from the game total and the spread. In an NFL game with a total of 48 and a spread of -6, the implied team totals are: Favorite = (48 + 6) / 2 = 27 and Underdog = (48 - 6) / 2 = 21. In practice, the actual team total lines posted by sportsbooks may differ slightly from this calculation due to rounding, vig adjustments, and independent pricing considerations, but they should be approximately consistent.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: Team Total Consistency Check</h4>
            <p>An NBA game has a total of 224 and a spread of -4. The implied team totals are: Favorite = (224 + 4) / 2 = 114 and Underdog = (224 - 4) / 2 = 110. If the sportsbook posts team totals of 115.5 and 108.5, the sum is 224 (consistent with the game total), but the difference is 7, not 4 (inconsistent with the spread). This type of discrepancy can arise when team totals are priced by a different trader or model than the game total and spread, and it represents a brief internal inconsistency within the sportsbook's markets.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Team Totals Matter</h3>

        <p>Team totals are important for understanding market correlation because they decompose the game into its constituent parts. The game total tells you about the overall scoring environment. The spread tells you about the expected difference between the teams. Team totals combine both pieces of information into a per-team scoring expectation, which then forms the basis for player-level derivative markets like points, rebounds, or passing yards.</p>

        <p>Movement in team totals can reveal information that movement in the game total or spread alone cannot. If a team total moves down without a corresponding change in the game total, it implies that the other team's total has moved up. This could indicate information specific to one team (a key defensive player being ruled out, for example) that affects both teams' scoring expectations in opposite directions.</p>

        <h3>Team Totals and Game Flow Expectations</h3>

        <p>Team totals also reflect market expectations about game flow. In a game with a large spread, the favorite's team total tends to be higher partly because of an expected "garbage time" effect: when one team leads by a wide margin, the trailing team may score additional points against prevent defenses or during extended play from behind, inflating both team totals. Conversely, in a game with a low total and a small spread, the market expects a tightly contested, low-scoring affair where both teams' scoring is compressed.</p>

        <h2 id="player-props">5. Player Props as Derivative Markets</h2>

        <p>Player prop markets represent the most granular level of the correlation hierarchy. A player's expected statistical output (points scored, passing yards, rebounds, shots on goal) is a function of the team's overall game plan, the game environment, and the player's individual matchup. All of these factors are captured, at least implicitly, in the core markets (spread, total, team totals), making player props derivative markets in the financial sense.</p>

        <h3>How Player Props Connect to Core Markets</h3>

        <p>A starting running back's rushing yards over/under is correlated with multiple core markets simultaneously. It is positively correlated with his team's spread (if the team is favored, they are more likely to run the ball in the second half to protect a lead, increasing rushing volume). It is positively correlated with the game total (higher-scoring games tend to feature more total plays, creating more opportunities for rushing attempts). And it is correlated with the team total (if the team is expected to score more points, the running back has more opportunities for goal-line carries and extended drives).</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: Quarterback Passing Yards and Game Context</h4>
            <p>Consider a quarterback whose passing yards over/under is set at 265.5. This number is not set in isolation; it reflects expectations about the game's likely script. If his team is a 10-point underdog with a game total of 50, the market expects the team to be trailing for much of the game, leading to a pass-heavy approach. This elevates the passing yards expectation. If the same quarterback's team were a 10-point favorite in a game with a total of 38, the expectation shifts toward a run-heavy approach with a lead, depressing the passing yards number. The prop number is downstream of the core market prices, which define the expected game environment.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Complexity of Prop Correlations</h3>

        <p>While the directional correlation between player props and core markets is generally predictable, the strength of that correlation varies significantly by sport, position, and prop type. In basketball, a star player's points over/under is strongly correlated with the team total and moderately correlated with the spread (blowout risk affects minutes played). In football, a wide receiver's receiving yards are correlated with both the team total and the game script (trailing teams throw more), but the correlation is weaker because individual target distributions can vary dramatically based on defensive scheme and coverage assignments.</p>

        <p>Some prop correlations are negative. A starting pitcher's strikeouts over/under in baseball may be negatively correlated with his team's run line, counterintuitively. If the pitcher is dominant enough to accumulate strikeouts, he is likely pitching deep into the game, suppressing the opposing team's scoring, which might push the game toward a blowout where the pitcher is removed early. These complex and sometimes contradictory correlations are what make player prop markets intellectually fascinating and structurally challenging for sportsbooks to price consistently.</p>

        <h3>Same-Game Parlays and Correlation Pricing</h3>

        <p>The rise of same-game parlays (SGPs) has brought market correlation to the forefront of the sports betting industry. Traditional parlays combine bets from different games, and because the outcomes of different games are independent, the parlay payout is simply the product of the individual odds. Same-game parlays combine bets from the same game, and because these bets are correlated, the true combined probability is not simply the product of the individual probabilities.</p>

        <p>Sportsbooks must adjust SGP pricing to account for correlations. If you parlay a team's moneyline with the over, these outcomes are positively correlated (a team winning tends to coincide with higher scoring), so the combined odds should be lower than what a naive multiplication of independent probabilities would produce. The challenge for sportsbooks is accurately quantifying the strength of each correlation, which varies based on the specific combination of legs, the sport, and the game context. Imprecise correlation estimates in SGP pricing can lead to structural mispricings that are not present in the individual markets.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Positive vs. Negative Correlation in SGPs</h4>
            <p>Positively correlated legs (where one outcome increases the likelihood of the other) should reduce the combined payout relative to independent odds. Examples include pairing a favorite's moneyline with the over, or a running back's rushing yards over with his team's spread. Negatively correlated legs (where one outcome decreases the likelihood of the other) should increase the combined payout. An example would be pairing the under with a quarterback's passing yards over, since low-scoring games tend to feature fewer passing yards. Sportsbooks must model both types of correlation accurately to avoid systematic over- or under-pricing SGPs.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="alternate-lines">6. Alternate Lines and Their Pricing</h2>

        <p>Alternate lines allow bettors to select spreads and totals that differ from the standard market line. Instead of taking a team at -3, a bettor can choose -1.5 (at worse odds) or -6.5 (at better odds). These alternate lines are directly correlated with the standard line and with each other, creating a continuum of prices across different point values.</p>

        <h3>The Pricing Curve</h3>

        <p>Alternate lines form a pricing curve where each point of movement away from the standard line comes at a predictable cost or benefit in terms of odds. Moving from a standard spread of -3 (-110) to an alternate spread of -1.5 might cost you juice (priced at -170), while moving to -6.5 would offer enhanced value (priced at +140). The shape of this curve reflects the probability distribution of scoring margins. In the NFL, the curve is not smooth; it has pronounced kinks at key numbers like 3 and 7, where a single additional point of spread carries a disproportionate probability impact.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: The Cost of Buying Points in the NFL</h4>
            <p>Suppose the standard line is Team A -3 (-110). To buy a half-point and take -2.5, you might pay -125. To buy a full point and take -2, you might pay -140. These costs reflect the probability that the game will land exactly on the margin you are crossing. Moving from -3 to -2.5 eliminates the push scenario on a 3-point margin (one of the most common margins in football), which is why buying through 3 is more expensive than buying through less significant numbers. Moving from -7.5 to -7 (crossing the key number 7) is similarly expensive, while moving from -8.5 to -8 is cheaper because the number 8 is not a common margin of victory.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Alternate Totals</h3>

        <p>The same pricing logic applies to alternate totals. If the standard total is 47, an alternate total of 44.5 for the over will be priced at lower odds (since it is more likely to hit), while 50.5 for the over will be priced at higher odds. The pricing of each alternate total must be internally consistent: the odds for over 44.5 plus the implied probability of under 44.5 should sum to approximately 100% (before vig). Any deviation represents an internal inconsistency that should, in theory, be corrected by market forces.</p>

        <h3>Consistency Requirements</h3>

        <p>Alternate lines create a web of correlated prices that must all be internally consistent. The odds at -1.5 must be consistent with the odds at -3, which must be consistent with the odds at -6.5, which must be consistent with the moneyline, which must be consistent with the team totals. Any inconsistency within this web represents a mispricing in at least one of the connected markets. The computational challenge of maintaining consistency across dozens of alternate lines, plus the core markets, plus player props, is enormous, and it is one of the structural reasons why perfect cross-market consistency is difficult to achieve in practice.</p>

        <h2 id="movement-cascades">7. How Movement Cascades Across Markets</h2>

        <p>When new information enters a betting market, it typically enters through one market first and then propagates to related markets. Understanding how this cascade works reveals the mechanics of cross-market pricing and highlights the challenges sportsbooks face in maintaining consistency.</p>

        <h3>The Typical Cascade Pattern</h3>

        <p>In most cases, new information enters through the most liquid market first. For an NFL game, this is typically the point spread. Sharp bettors, reacting to new information (an injury report, a weather change, or their own model output), place wagers on the spread. The sportsbook adjusts the spread in response. This adjustment must then cascade to related markets: the moneyline should adjust to remain consistent with the new spread, the game total might need to adjust if the information affects scoring expectations, team totals should shift to remain consistent with both the spread and the total, and player props may need recalibration based on the new game environment expectations.</p>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <h4>Key Concept: Cascade Latency</h4>
            <p>The cascade from a primary market movement to adjustment in secondary and tertiary markets is not instantaneous. There is a latency period during which the primary market (say, the spread) has already moved to its new price, but the secondary markets (moneyline, team totals, player props) have not yet adjusted. During this latency window, the secondary markets are, by definition, inconsistent with the primary market. The length of this window varies by sportsbook (some have faster automated systems), by market type (liquid markets adjust faster), and by the magnitude of the triggering information (large movements cascade faster because they are more urgent).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Directional Cascades</h3>

        <p>Not all information triggers movement in all markets. Some information is side-specific: learning that a team's best offensive player is ruled out affects the spread and the team totals but may have limited impact on the game total if the opposing team is also expected to score fewer points against a less potent offense (defensive game script). Other information is total-specific: a weather report showing sustained 25 mph winds in an NFL game depresses the total without necessarily changing the spread, because wind affects both teams' scoring roughly equally.</p>

        <p>The most complex cascade scenarios occur when information affects both the side and the total asymmetrically. If a star quarterback is ruled out and replaced by a significantly inferior backup, the spread should widen (the team with the backup is less likely to win), the game total might decrease (the team with the backup will likely score fewer points), and the team totals will shift asymmetrically (one team's total drops more than the other's). Each of these adjustments must be quantified and implemented across all related markets.</p>

        <h3>Cross-Sport Cascades</h3>

        <p>In certain situations, information in one game can cascade to markets on other games. This is most common in tournament or playoff settings where the result of one game determines the opponent in a subsequent game. If a team unexpectedly loses, it can affect futures odds for the entire bracket and may even impact the lines on other games involving teams that would have faced the losing team in a later round. These cross-event cascades are rarer and weaker than within-event cascades, but they illustrate the interconnected nature of the broader betting market ecosystem.</p>

        <h2 id="when-correlations-break">8. When Correlations Break Down</h2>

        <p>Under normal conditions, the correlations between related markets hold because sportsbooks actively maintain consistency. However, there are several situations where correlations can break down, either temporarily or structurally.</p>

        <h3>Cascade Latency Gaps</h3>

        <p>As described above, the latency between a primary market movement and the corresponding adjustment in secondary markets creates brief windows of inconsistency. These gaps are most common immediately after significant news breaks (injury announcements, lineup changes) when the primary market adjusts rapidly and the derivative markets have not yet caught up. The duration of these gaps varies, but in modern sportsbooks with automated pricing systems, they are typically measured in seconds to minutes for liquid markets, and potentially longer for less liquid markets like player props.</p>

        <h3>Different Market Makers</h3>

        <p>When different markets are priced by different traders, models, or even different sportsbooks entirely, correlation breaks are more likely. A sportsbook might use one model for the spread and a different model for the team totals, and these models may produce slightly different implied views of the same game. Similarly, a bettor shopping across multiple sportsbooks might find that Sportsbook A's spread implies a different win probability than Sportsbook B's moneyline on the same game. These cross-sportsbook inconsistencies are more persistent than within-sportsbook inconsistencies because there is no single entity responsible for reconciling the prices.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: Cross-Sportsbook Inconsistency</h4>
            <p>Sportsbook A has the Packers at -3 (-110), implying a win probability of approximately 59.5%. Sportsbook B has the Packers' moneyline at -140, implying a win probability of approximately 58.3% (after removing vig). These two prices are inconsistent: the spread at one sportsbook implies the Packers are more likely to win than the moneyline at another sportsbook suggests. This type of cross-sportsbook discrepancy is common because each sportsbook is pricing to its own customer base and risk profile, not to maintain consistency with competitors.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Stale Markets</h3>

        <p>Some derivative markets are less actively monitored and updated than core markets. A player prop that was priced at 8 AM might not be updated until the afternoon, during which time the core markets have moved. If the spread has shifted by 2 points since the prop was priced, the prop is now stale relative to the current market view. These stale prices represent a structural breakdown in correlation that persists until the sportsbook updates the derivative market.</p>

        <h3>In-Play Market Desynchronization</h3>

        <p>During live betting, the challenge of maintaining cross-market consistency is amplified dramatically. In-game events (a goal, a turnover, an injury) change the state of the game instantly, and all markets must adjust simultaneously. In practice, some markets adjust faster than others. The core in-play spread might update within seconds, while an in-play player prop might take longer to recalibrate. During these desynchronization windows, the correlations between live markets can temporarily break down.</p>

        <h3>Structural Limits of Correlation Models</h3>

        <p>Even when sportsbooks attempt to maintain cross-market consistency, the complexity of modeling all possible correlations is enormous. A single NBA game might have 200+ individual markets (spread, moneyline, total, first-half markets, quarter markets, team totals, alternate lines, and player props for 20+ players across 5+ statistical categories). Maintaining perfect mathematical consistency across all of these markets in real time is computationally challenging, and in practice, sportsbooks accept a degree of imprecision in their less liquid markets in order to focus pricing resources on the markets that generate the most volume.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>The Multi-Market Consistency Problem</h4>
            <p>Consider the scale of the consistency challenge: for a single NFL game, a sportsbook might offer a standard spread, standard moneyline, standard total, first-half spread, first-half total, first-half moneyline, first-quarter markets, second-half markets, 10+ alternate spreads, 10+ alternate totals, 2 team totals, and 50+ player props. Each of these markets must be approximately consistent with every other market, creating thousands of pairwise consistency constraints. Perfectly satisfying all of these constraints simultaneously, while also maintaining competitive pricing and managing risk, is effectively impossible. This is why some degree of cross-market mispricing is a permanent structural feature of sports betting markets, not a temporary error.</p>

        <h2 id="key-takeaways">9. Key Takeaways</h2>

        <div class="key-concept">
            <h4>Summary: What You Need to Know About Correlated Betting Markets</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All betting markets on a single event are mathematically connected through a shared underlying probability distribution of possible game outcomes. The spread, moneyline, total, team totals, and player props are all different expressions of this same distribution.</li>
                <li>The spread and moneyline are tightly correlated: a team favored by N points should have a moneyline that reflects the historical probability of teams favored by N points winning outright. Key numbers (3 and 7 in football) create non-linearities in this conversion.</li>
                <li>The spread and total are connected through team totals. Team A Expected Score = (Total + Spread) / 2 and Team B Expected Score = (Total - Spread) / 2. Movement in either the spread or the total has implications for team totals.</li>
                <li>Player props are derivative markets whose pricing depends on the expected game environment as defined by the core markets. Game script expectations (implied by the spread) and scoring environment expectations (implied by the total) both flow into player-level projections.</li>
                <li>Alternate lines form a pricing curve that must be consistent with the standard line and with each other. In football, the cost of buying or selling points is higher at key numbers (3, 7) because these margins occur disproportionately often.</li>
                <li>When new information enters the market, it typically enters through the most liquid market first and then cascades to derivative markets. The latency of this cascade creates brief windows of cross-market inconsistency.</li>
                <li>Correlations break down due to cascade latency, different market makers pricing different markets, stale derivative market prices, in-play desynchronization, and the sheer computational complexity of maintaining consistency across hundreds of related markets.</li>
                <li>Same-game parlays have made correlation pricing a front-of-house consumer product. Accurately pricing the correlation between legs is one of the most significant structural challenges in modern sportsbook operations.</li>
                <li>Perfect cross-market consistency is effectively impossible given the number of markets, the speed of information change, and the computational constraints of real-time pricing. Some degree of cross-market imprecision is a permanent structural feature of sports betting.</li>
