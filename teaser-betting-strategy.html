        <h1>Teaser Betting Strategy: When 6 Points Change Everything</h1>
        <p class="lead">Teasers are among the most misunderstood bets in sports gambling. Most bettors use them as a crutch for weak convictions, turning bad bets into worse ones. But when deployed strategically around key numbers, teasers can offer genuine mathematical edge. The difference between losing teaser bettors and winning ones comes down to understanding exactly when those extra points create value and when they're just expensive insurance.</p>

        <h2 id="teaser-basics">Teaser Basics: What You're Actually Betting</h2>

        <p>A teaser is a parlay with a twist. Instead of betting multiple sides at their posted spreads, you get to move each spread 6, 6.5, or 7 points in your favor. The catch is that all legs must win for the teaser to pay, and the payout is reduced to account for the more favorable lines you're receiving.</p>

        <p>The standard 2-team, 6-point NFL teaser typically pays between -120 and -135 at most regulated US sportsbooks in 2025-26. Compare that to a standard 2-team parlay that pays roughly +260. You're giving up significant payout potential in exchange for 6 points of cushion on each leg. The question is whether those 6 points make your legs safe enough to justify the reduced return.</p>

        <p>Here's the fundamental insight most bettors miss: not all 6-point moves are created equal. Moving a spread from -8 to -2 crosses through the key numbers 7 and 3. Moving from -10 to -4 crosses through one key number (7) and lands awkwardly. The value of your teaser depends entirely on which numbers you're crossing and where you're landing.</p>

        <h2 id="wong-teaser">The Wong Teaser: A Strategy That Actually Works</h2>

        <p>Stanford Wong, the legendary gambling author and mathematician, identified the specific conditions under which NFL teasers offer positive expected value. His research, published in "Sharp Sports Betting" in 2001, focused on crossing through the most important key numbers: 3 and 7. The strategy has been validated by subsequent analysis and remains the foundation of profitable teaser betting.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <span class="big-number">15%</span>
            <span class="stat-label">of NFL games are decided by exactly 3 points</span>
        </div>

        <h3>The Wong Teaser Criteria</h3>

        <p>A proper Wong Teaser leg meets these conditions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Favorites between -7.5 and -8.5:</strong> Teasing down 6 points takes you to -1.5 to -2.5, crossing through 7 and 3. You now need only a win by 2+ points, not a full touchdown cover.</li>
            <li><strong>Underdogs between +1.5 and +2.5:</strong> Teasing up 6 points takes you to +7.5 to +8.5, crossing through 3 and 7. You gain significant cushion on a team that was already close to pick'em.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Wong's research showed that combining two legs that meet these criteria yields an expected win rate high enough to overcome the reduced payout. The math works because you're not just getting 6 points; you're getting 6 points that cross through the margins of victory that occur most frequently.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <span class="big-number">~8%</span>
            <span class="stat-label">of NFL games are decided by exactly 7 points</span>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example: A Proper Wong Teaser</h4>
            <p><strong>Leg 1:</strong> Chiefs -7.5 teased to Chiefs -1.5. Crosses through 7, 6, 3. Now you just need Kansas City to win by 2 or more.</p>
            <p><strong>Leg 2:</strong> Packers +2 teased to Packers +8. Crosses through 3 and 7. Green Bay can lose by a full touchdown and you still win.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Both legs meet Wong criteria. This teaser has historically shown positive expectation at reasonable prices.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Why These Specific Numbers?</h3>

        <p>The logic behind Wong's criteria connects directly to margin of victory distribution. NFL games are decided by 3 points approximately 15% of the time and by 7 points about 8% of the time. Together, these two numbers account for roughly 23% of all NFL outcomes, an extraordinary concentration around just two margins.</p>

        <p>When you tease a favorite from -8 to -2, you're crossing through both of these critical thresholds. When you tease an underdog from +2 to +8, you're getting past both 3 and 7. Your team can now lose by a field goal, lose by a touchdown, or win outright. You've covered the three most likely "close loss" scenarios.</p>

        <h2 id="nfl-teasers">NFL Teasers: Where the Value Lives</h2>

        <p>The NFL is teaser territory. Football's scoring structure, built around 3-point field goals and 7-point touchdowns, creates the cluster of outcomes around key numbers that makes teaser strategy viable. No other major sport has this same concentration of final margins around specific numbers.</p>

                <td style="color: var(--red);">No</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Critical Rule: Never Tease Through Zero</h4>
            <p>Teasing a -3 favorite to +3 might seem appealing, but it's mathematically wasteful. You're using 6 points to cross only one meaningful threshold (0). Wong's research specifically excludes these plays. The key numbers that matter are 3 and 7, not 0.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="2025-reality">The 2025-26 Reality: Books Have Adjusted</h2>

        <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: sportsbooks have long since noticed the Wong Teaser edge. In 2025-26, standard 2-leg, 6-point NFL teasers at regulated US books are typically priced at -120 to -135, not the -110 that existed when Wong first published his research. Some books charge even more during high-demand periods.</p>

        <p>This repricing squeezes the margin that made classic Wong spots so appealing. At -110, you needed roughly 72.4% combined win rate to break even. At -130, you need approximately 75%. That's a meaningful difference when dealing with an edge that was never huge to begin with.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>Making Wong Teasers Work in 2025</h4>
            <p>The strategy still works under specific conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price sensitivity is mandatory:</strong> Only play at -120 or better (ideally -110 if you can find it)</li>
                <li><strong>Filter for low totals:</strong> Games with totals under 49 points tend to have more meaningful key number effects</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid DraftKings and FanDuel blindly:</strong> Their pricing models are designed to crush this specific strategy</li>
                <li><strong>Shop across books:</strong> Pricing varies significantly, and a few points of juice matter enormously over time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Last season, blindly playing all 6-point, two-leg Wong Teaser candidates hit above 62% of the time, which was highly profitable even at -120 or -130 rates. However, that performance is likely not sustainable. Realistic expectations for the current season are above 54.5% but below 56.5%, which is still profitable at good prices but requires discipline.</p>

        <h2 id="nba-teasers">NBA Teasers: A Different Calculation</h2>

        <p>Basketball teasers require different thinking than football teasers. The NBA doesn't have the same key number structure because scoring isn't built around specific point values. A 3-pointer and a 2-pointer create less predictable margin clustering than a field goal and a touchdown.</p>

        <p>Standard NBA teasers give 4 or 4.5 points. Because basketball margins are more evenly distributed and games are higher-scoring, these points offer less structural advantage than NFL teasers. There's no equivalent to the Wong Teaser in basketball; no specific spread ranges have been identified as consistently profitable for teasing.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>Caution: NBA Teasers</h4>
            <p>Most professional bettors avoid NBA teasers entirely. The combination of reduced payouts, the lack of key numbers, and the high variance of basketball scoring makes these bets mathematically unfavorable in most circumstances. If you're going to bet basketball, straight spreads or moneylines typically offer better value.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="teaser-math">The Math Behind Profitable Teasers</h2>

        <p>Understanding the breakeven math is essential for teaser betting. The calculation depends on the price you're getting and the number of legs in your teaser.</p>

        <h3>Breakeven Analysis by Teaser Price (2-Team)</h3>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Teaser Price</th>
                <th>Combined Breakeven Win Rate</th>
                <th>Per-Leg Win Rate Needed</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-110</td>
                <td>52.4%</td>
                <td>72.4%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-115</td>
                <td>53.5%</td>
                <td>73.1%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-120</td>
                <td>54.5%</td>
                <td>73.8%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-125</td>
                <td>55.5%</td>
                <td>74.5%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-130</td>
                <td>56.5%</td>
                <td>75.2%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>-135</td>
                <td>57.4%</td>
                <td>75.8%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Every 5 points of extra juice raises the bar significantly. A teaser at -130 requires nearly 3% higher win rate per leg than one at -110. Over hundreds of bets, this difference determines whether you're profitable or slowly bleeding money.</p>

        <h3>Why 6 Points Beats 7</h3>

        <p>Books offer teasers at various sizes: 6 points, 6.5 points, 7 points, and sometimes larger. The extra half-point or full point in larger teasers doesn't cross any additional key numbers in most cases. If you're teasing from -8 to -2 with 6 points, going to -1.5 or -1 with 6.5 or 7 points doesn't materially improve your position.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, books charge more juice for larger teasers. The mathematical sweet spot for NFL teasers remains 6 points at the best available price.</p>

        <h2 id="teaser-mistakes">Teaser Mistakes That Cost You Money</h2>

        <h3>Mistake 1: Using Teasers as Parlay Insurance</h3>

        <p>The most common teaser error is treating them as a way to make a bad parlay safer. If you're combining two games because you like them together and then teasing for safety, you're probably making a negative-expectation bet. Teasers should be constructed around key numbers, not around games you wanted to parlay anyway.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 2: Teasing Through Zero</h3>

        <p>Taking a -3 favorite to +3 wastes your 6 points crossing through zero instead of maximizing key number crossings. This is one of the most common amateur mistakes. The math doesn't support it.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 3: Betting 3-Team or 4-Team Teasers</h3>

        <p>Each additional leg dramatically increases the probability of a loss. A 3-team teaser at +180 might seem attractive, but the math rarely works. You need all three legs to hit, and even strong legs have failure rates that compound. Stick with 2-team teasers.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 4: Ignoring Price</h3>

        <p>Blindly betting teasers at whatever price your book offers is a recipe for slow losses. The difference between -110 and -130 is the difference between a winning and losing strategy. Shop aggressively for teaser prices.</p>

        <h3>Mistake 5: Teasing High-Total Games</h3>

        <p>Key numbers carry less weight in high-scoring affairs. When the total is 52+, the game is more likely to be a shootout where margins are less predictable. Filtering for totals under 49 improves your Wong Teaser performance.</p>
