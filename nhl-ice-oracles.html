      <div class="m-odds"><b>Records:</b> Avalanche (6-1-4) vs Golden Knights (6-1-3)</div>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p><b>Elite matchup on Nevada Day:</b> This Friday afternoon contest features two of the NHL's best teams, both sporting identical 6-1-3 records. These are the only two teams in the league with just one regulation loss through 10 games. This Nevada Day special is a showcase of Western Conference supremacy—Colorado's high-flying offensive attack versus Vegas's balanced, disciplined approach.</p>
        <p><b>Jack Eichel chasing history:</b> Golden Knights center Jack Eichel leads the entire NHL with 19 points through 10 games (6 goals, 13 assists). He's on pace to become the fastest player in Vegas franchise history to reach 20 points. Eichel has been dominant on home ice, where his playmaking elevates linemates and creates scoring chances at an elite rate. His chemistry with Mark Stone has been Vegas's most dangerous weapon.</p>
        <p><b>Nathan MacKinnon's goal-scoring surge:</b> Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon enters with 9 goals, tied for the NHL lead alongside several other elite scorers. MacKinnon's ability to score from distance, in tight, and on the rush makes him nearly impossible to contain. The Avalanche's transition game runs through MacKinnon, and when he's finding the net at this rate, Colorado becomes one of the most dangerous offensive teams in hockey.</p>
        <p><b>Offensive firepower collision:</b> Both teams boast elite offensive talent. Colorado generates high-danger chances off the rush and through sustained zone time. Vegas counters with a balanced attack that can score in waves. When two teams this skilled meet, defensive structure becomes critical. Vegas has the home-ice edge to dictate matchups with last change, but Colorado has the speed to neutralize Vegas's defensive pairings.</p>
        <p><b>Goaltending will decide it:</b> With this much offensive talent on both sides, the goaltending matchup becomes paramount. Both teams have reliable netminders, but whichever goalie can steal a few high-danger saves will give their team the edge. Afternoon games can create rhythm issues for goalies adjusting to unusual start times, so whoever settles in faster gains an advantage.</p>
        <p><b>Special teams matter:</b> Both teams have dangerous power plays capable of capitalizing on opportunities. Colorado's PP features MacKinnon and Cale Makar as elite weapons. Vegas's PP runs through Eichel's playmaking and Stone's finishing ability. Discipline will be crucial—taking undisciplined penalties against these power plays is a quick path to a loss.</p>
        <p><b>What to watch:</b> This is a playoff-intensity game in October. Both teams know they're measuring themselves against Western Conference elite competition. Expect a fast-paced, skilled game with multiple lead changes and high-event hockey. The team that executes defensively in the third period will likely come out ahead. Neutral fans should tune in—this is the type of NHL showcase that delivers entertainment.</p>

      <div class="m-odds"><b>Records:</b> Capitals (6-4-0) vs Islanders (4-5-1)</div>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p><b>Ovechkin chasing 900 career goals:</b> The biggest storyline in this game is Alex Ovechkin sitting just one goal away from 900 career NHL goals. If he scores tonight, he becomes the first player in NHL history to reach that milestone. Ovechkin has historically dominated the Islanders with 45 goals in 75 career games against them, so this is an ideal matchup for him to make history. Every time Ovechkin touches the puck on the power play or gets open in his office, the crowd will be on its feet.</p>
        <p><b>Washington's offensive drought:</b> The Capitals have struggled offensively lately, scoring just one goal in their last two games. They're coming off a 1-0 shutout loss to Dallas, which has left their forwards searching for rhythm. Beyond Ovechkin's pursuit of 900, Washington needs contributions from their secondary scoring. If the Islanders' defense can neutralize Ovechkin and limit Washington's top line, the Capitals' offense could continue to sputter.</p>
        <p><b>Matthew Schaefer's rookie emergence:</b> Islanders rookie Matthew Schaefer has been a revelation with 8 points through his first 10 NHL games, ranking second among all rookies in scoring. He brings energy, speed, and playmaking ability that has elevated New York's offense. His ability to create chances off the rush and contribute on the power play has given the Islanders a dimension they desperately needed early in the season.</p>
        <p><b>Defensive structure vs offensive desperation:</b> The Islanders play a tight, structured defensive system designed to limit high-danger chances and frustrate skilled forwards. Washington will need to find ways to generate quality chances against New York's defensive shell, especially with their recent offensive struggles. If the Capitals can't solve the Islanders' defense early, frustration could set in and lead to undisciplined penalties.</p>
        <p><b>Goaltending and special teams:</b> Both teams have capable goaltending that can steal games. The Islanders' penalty kill will be tested by Washington's power play, which runs through Ovechkin's one-timer from the left circle. If New York takes penalties, Ovechkin will get his chances to hit 900. Conversely, if the Islanders can stay disciplined and force Washington to score at 5-on-5, the Capitals' offensive drought could continue.</p>
        <p><b>What to watch:</b> All eyes will be on Ovechkin every time he steps on the ice. This is a historic moment waiting to happen. Beyond the milestone chase, this is a Metropolitan Division game with playoff implications. The Islanders need to protect home ice and build momentum, while Washington needs to break out of their offensive slump and get contributions beyond Ovechkin.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p><b>John Gibson's emotional homecoming:</b> Red Wings goaltender John Gibson faces his former team for the first time since being traded from Anaheim to Detroit on June 28. Gibson spent his first 12 NHL seasons in Anaheim, appearing in 506 games and winning 204—the second-most in franchise history. This will be an emotional night for Gibson as he returns to Honda Center, where he made his name as one of the league's premier goaltenders during the Ducks' competitive years.</p>
        <p><b>Detroit's hot start continues:</b> The Red Wings enter with an impressive 8-3-0 record, one of the best starts in franchise history. Detroit's offense has been balanced, with contributions from all four lines, and their defense has tightened up significantly under their new system. Gibson's acquisition has stabilized their goaltending, and his experience in pressure situations has given Detroit confidence in tight games.</p>
        <p><b>Gibson's motivation factor:</b> Playing against your former team always adds extra motivation, especially for a goaltender who spent over a decade with one organization. Gibson knows Anaheim's shooters intimately—their tendencies, their release points, their favorite moves. That familiarity could give him an edge in reading plays and anticipating shots. Expect Gibson to be locked in emotionally for this one.</p>
        <p><b>Anaheim's rebuild continues:</b> The Ducks are in the midst of a rebuild with a young core developing around Trevor Zegras, Mason McTavish, and Leo Carlsson. Anaheim has shown flashes of offensive brilliance but lacks the defensive consistency and depth to compete with playoff-caliber teams like Detroit. The Ducks will want to give Gibson a tough night and honor his legacy with a competitive effort, but talent disparity matters over sixty minutes.</p>
        <p><b>Offensive depth vs youth:</b> Detroit has the veteran presence and depth to grind out road wins. Anaheim relies heavily on their young stars to create offense, and when those players are neutralized, the Ducks struggle to generate sustained pressure. Detroit's experience in late-game situations gives them an edge if this game is close in the third period.</p>
        <p><b>What to watch:</b> The pre-game video tribute to John Gibson will be emotional. Ducks fans will give him a standing ovation, and Gibson will acknowledge the crowd before trying to shut them down for sixty minutes. Beyond the storyline, this is a measuring-stick game for Anaheim—can their young core compete with a playoff-bound team like Detroit? The Red Wings will want to take care of business on the road and keep their hot start rolling.</p>

      <div class="m-odds"><b>Line:</b> Tampa Bay Lightning -155 <span class="unit-tag">2 UNITS</span> | <b>Total:</b> 6.0</div>
      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: Tampa Bay is a home favorite at -155 in this nationally televised TNT showcase. The Lightning are getting healthy at the right time and return to Amalie Arena where they've been dominant early this season. Dallas comes in on a back-to-back after playing in Florida last night, which creates immediate fatigue and travel concerns.</p>
        <p>Back-to-back disadvantage for Dallas: The Stars played in Sunrise against the Panthers last night and now travel to Tampa with zero rest. Road back-to-backs are brutal in the NHL—goalies face more rubber when tired, defensive coverage breaks down in the third period, and offensive execution suffers. Tampa Bay is fresh, rested, and playing at home. That energy differential matters over sixty minutes.</p>
        <p>Home ice dominance: The Lightning have been exceptional at Amalie Arena early this season. They control matchups with last change, feed off crowd energy, and execute their transition game at a higher level at home. Tampa's power play clicks at home, and their defensive structure tightens when they can dictate tempo. Dallas won't have the legs to match Tampa's speed through the neutral zone.</p>
        <p>Goaltending edge: Tampa Bay's goaltending has been reliable at home this season. Dallas will likely start their backup on the second night of a back-to-back, which tilts the goaltending matchup heavily toward the Lightning. When you pair a rested home goalie against a backup on tired legs, scoring chances convert at a higher rate for the home team.</p>
        <p>Offensive firepower vs defensive fatigue: Tampa's top line featuring Kucherov and Point can exploit tired defensive pairs. Dallas will struggle to rotate effectively in their own zone, especially in the third period when fatigue compounds. The Lightning generate high-danger chances off the rush, and Dallas's defense will be a step slow recovering on odd-man breaks.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: Tampa Bay jumps ahead early with their speed game, forcing Dallas to chase. The Stars hang around through the second period, but the Lightning pull away in the third when Dallas's fatigue becomes overwhelming. Final score lands around 4-2 or 5-3 for Tampa Bay. The -155 price is justified for a rested home team against a tired road squad.</p>
        <p><b>The pick: Tampa Bay Lightning -155 (2 Units)</b></p>

      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The Rangers are getting +138 as road underdogs in Edmonton, which creates value on a veteran team that knows how to win on the road. Edmonton has been inconsistent at home early this season, and the Rangers have the defensive structure and goaltending to frustrate the Oilers' high-octane offense.</p>
        <p>Goaltending advantage: Igor Shesterkin is one of the elite goaltenders in the NHL. He steals games on the road, makes timely saves in high-leverage moments, and gives the Rangers confidence to play a tight defensive system. Edmonton's goaltending has been shaky at home, especially against teams that limit high-danger chances. If Shesterkin is dialed in, the Rangers can win a low-scoring game.</p>
        <p>Defensive system vs offensive chaos: The Rangers play a structured, disciplined defensive game. They clog the neutral zone, force dump-ins, and limit transition opportunities for skilled forwards like McDavid and Draisaitl. Edmonton wants to play wide-open hockey with lots of odd-man rushes, but the Rangers don't give up those chances easily. If New York can keep this game tight and defensive, they have the goaltending edge to win.</p>
        <p>Road professionalism: The Rangers are a veteran team that plays the same structured game whether they're home or away. They don't get rattled by hostile environments, they stick to their system, and they grind out wins through defense and goaltending. At +138, you're getting plus-money on a team that can absolutely win this game straight-up.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: The Rangers keep this game low-scoring through the first two periods with tight defensive structure and strong goaltending from Shesterkin. Edmonton presses in the third, but the Rangers capitalize on a counter-attack or power play opportunity to take the lead. Even if Edmonton ties it late, this game goes to overtime and the Rangers steal a road win.</p>

        <p>Market context: Vancouver is getting +135 as road underdogs against a St. Louis team that has been inconsistent at home. The Canucks have offensive firepower and solid goaltending, and at this price, the value is too good to pass up. This is a spot where a talented road team is being undervalued by the market.</p>
        <p>Offensive talent edge: Vancouver has skilled forwards who can score in bunches when they get rolling. Pettersson, Miller, and Boeser form one of the more dangerous top lines in the Western Conference. St. Louis's defense has been vulnerable at home, especially when facing speed and skill on the rush. If the Canucks get their transition game going, they can put up goals quickly.</p>
        <p>Value proposition: At +135, you're getting paid to take a shot on a talented road team that's perfectly capable of winning this game outright. The Canucks don't need to dominate—they just need to execute their game plan and get timely goaltending. Even if this only cashes once every three times, the +135 price makes it profitable long-term.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: Vancouver scores first with their speed game, putting St. Louis in chase mode. The Blues respond, but the Canucks match them goal-for-goal through the second period. In the third, Vancouver's skill makes the difference with a power play goal or a high-danger chance off the rush. Final score lands around 4-3 or 3-2 for the Canucks.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: Columbus is getting plus-money at home (+106) against a Toronto team that's been dreadful on the road. The Leafs are 0-2-0 away from Scotiabank Arena this season and have lost four of their last five road games. Meanwhile, Columbus tied a franchise record last season with 57 home points and scored 161 goals at Nationwide Arena—the most in the entire NHL. This price is a gift for a home team with this much statistical dominance.</p>
        <p>Back-to-back fatigue tilts heavily toward Columbus: Both teams played last night, but the circumstances couldn't be more different. Toronto hosted Calgary and now travels to Columbus on zero rest. Columbus won in Buffalo in overtime and returns home to their own building. Road back-to-backs are exponentially more difficult than home ones. The travel, the hostile environment, the inability to dictate matchups—it all compounds when you're playing on tired legs.</p>
        <p>Toronto's road struggles are chronic, not coincidental: The Leafs are 0-2-0 on the road with an alarming 2-8-0 record against the spread this season. They've lost four of their last five away from home. This isn't bad luck—it's a pattern. Toronto's defense has been atrocious, allowing 3.6 goals per game, and on the road where they can't control matchups, those defensive lapses get exposed even more brutally.</p>
        <p>Goaltending mismatch favors Columbus heavily: Elvis Merzlikins is 3-1-0 this season with a 2.96 GAA and .914 save percentage. He's playing at home where he's historically been strong. Toronto counters with Cayden Primeau, who was just claimed off waivers on October 6. Primeau has a 3.46 GAA and .875 save percentage in limited action. He hasn't built chemistry with Toronto's defensive system yet, and he's facing a hostile road environment on zero rest. This goaltending edge alone justifies taking Columbus at plus-money.</p>
        <p>Dmitri Voronkov and Columbus's offense are rolling: Voronkov leads the Blue Jackets with nine points through eight games and has recorded a point in seven consecutive contests. He scored twice against Pittsburgh at home and has been consistently dangerous. Columbus averages 3.1 goals per game, and against Toronto's porous 3.6 goals-against average, they'll generate quality scoring chances all night. Nylander leads Toronto with 15 points, but Auston Matthews has been quiet (just eight points, only one 5v5 goal in seven games).</p>
        <p>Head-to-head dominance creates psychological edge: Columbus demolished Toronto 6-2 at Nationwide Arena earlier this season on October 22. Noni Madueke scored a hat-trick, and the Blue Jackets dominated every phase of the game. Toronto remembers that beatdown. When a team gets humiliated like that, especially on the road, it creates doubt. Columbus knows they can beat this Leafs squad, and Toronto knows they couldn't handle Columbus's physicality and forecheck last time.</p>
        <p>Special teams and discipline matter: Columbus has struggled on special teams this season (11.1% power play, 50% penalty kill), but Toronto isn't much better with a 12.5% power play (28th in NHL). Both teams have issues, but Columbus's home ice advantage and momentum give them the edge in crucial moments. The Blue Jackets are 6-3-0 ATS this season, showing they're undervalued by the market consistently.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: Columbus jumps ahead early, capitalizing on Toronto's tired legs and defensive breakdowns. Merzlikins makes key saves when Toronto pushes back. Voronkov and Marchenko generate scoring chances off the forecheck, and Columbus builds a two-goal lead by the second intermission. Even if Toronto scores late, Columbus holds on for a 3-2 or 4-2 victory. At +106, this is exceptional value for a home team with every advantage.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The Flyers are home favorites at -165 against a struggling Penguins squad. Pittsburgh comes in with defensive issues and inconsistent goaltending, while Philadelphia has been generating quality scoring chances and executing their home game plan effectively. The -165 price reflects Philadelphia's clear home ice advantage and superior underlying metrics.</p>
        <p>Matchup dynamics: The Penguins have struggled on the road this season, particularly against physical, north-south teams like the Flyers. Pittsburgh's aging core has shown vulnerability in back-to-back situations and road trips, and their defensive breakdowns have been exploited by teams that can forecheck aggressively. Philadelphia plays exactly that style—they pressure the puck, create turnovers in the neutral zone, and capitalize on mistakes.</p>
        <p>Goaltending edge: Philadelphia's goaltending has been steady at home, giving them a reliable last line of defense. Pittsburgh's netminding has been inconsistent, especially when facing high-danger chances from in tight. The Flyers' ability to generate net-front traffic and create second-chance opportunities plays directly into this weakness.</p>
        <p>Special teams: Philadelphia's power play has been clicking at home, moving the puck efficiently and getting quality shots from the slot. The Penguins' penalty kill has been below average, and if Pittsburgh takes undisciplined penalties—which they've done frequently on the road—the Flyers will capitalize with the man advantage.</p>
        <p>Home ice matters: Wells Fargo Center gives the Flyers a legitimate edge. The crowd energy lifts Philadelphia's intensity, and they control the last change to get favorable matchups. Pittsburgh's road struggles combined with Philly's home success creates a scenario where the Flyers should dictate pace and impose their will over sixty minutes.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: Philadelphia establishes their forecheck early, generates sustained offensive zone time, and builds a lead through the first forty minutes. Even if Pittsburgh pushes back in the third, the Flyers have the defensive structure and goaltending to protect a one or two-goal margin. The -165 price is justified and offers value.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The Kings are massive road favorites at -210 against a rebuilding Sharks team that's been one of the worst teams in the NHL. San Jose has struggled defensively all season, giving up high-danger chances at an alarming rate and getting inconsistent goaltending. The -210 line is steep, but when you're betting a playoff-caliber team against a lottery team on the road, the price reflects reality.</p>
        <p>Talent disparity: This is the core issue. The Kings have legitimate NHL depth across all four lines and three defensive pairings. The Sharks are icing multiple AHL-caliber players and relying on young prospects who aren't ready for prime-time minutes. When the talent gap is this wide, the better team wins at a high clip even on the road.</p>
        <p>Goaltending mismatch: Los Angeles gets above-average goaltending and plays a structured defensive system that limits quality chances against. San Jose's goaltending has been shaky, and even when they get a decent performance, their defense hangs them out to dry with breakdowns and turnovers. The Kings will generate clean looks, and the Sharks' netminder will face constant pressure.</p>
        <p>Offensive execution vs defensive chaos: LA's offensive system is built on puck possession, cycling low, and creating net-front traffic. The Sharks' defensive zone coverage is disorganized, they struggle to clear rebounds, and they give up second and third chances on nearly every shift. The Kings don't need to get fancy—they'll score by being in the right spots and finishing the chances that San Jose's mistakes create.</p>
        <p>Special teams edge: The Kings have a competent power play that can capitalize when given opportunities. The Sharks' penalty kill has been among the worst in the league, and if San Jose takes penalties—which young, undisciplined teams often do—LA will cash in with the man advantage. On the flip side, the Kings' PK is structured enough to limit San Jose's anemic power play.</p>
        <p>Road professionalism: The Kings are a veteran team that knows how to play road games. They don't get loose or complacent, they stick to their system, and they grind out wins even when the building is quiet. San Jose lacks the firepower or defensive structure to make this competitive over sixty minutes.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: LA jumps ahead early, establishes their forecheck, and builds a multi-goal lead by the midpoint of the game. San Jose will have moments of offensive pressure, but the Kings' goaltending and defensive structure absorb those pushes. LA controls the third period, adds insurance, and wins by two or three goals. The -210 price is justified.</p>

      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The Islanders are road favorites at -145 in Boston, which is notable given the Bruins' typically strong home ice advantage. This line suggests the market respects New York's recent form and sees vulnerabilities in Boston's game. The Islanders have been playing structured, winning hockey, while the Bruins have shown inconsistency at home.</p>
        <p>Systematic execution advantage: The Islanders play the exact style that frustrates high-skill teams like Boston. They clog the neutral zone, limit transition opportunities, and force opponents into low-percentage perimeter shots. The Bruins want to play an up-tempo, skill-based game, but the Islanders' defensive structure takes that away. When Boston is forced into half-ice sets against a packed-in defense, their offense stalls.</p>
        <p>Goaltending edge: New York's goaltending has been steady on the road, giving them a reliable backstop even in hostile environments. Boston's goaltending has been inconsistent at home, and when the Islanders get quality chances—particularly from in tight—they've shown the ability to capitalize. The goaltending matchup tilts toward New York.</p>
        <p>Special teams matter: The Islanders have a disciplined penalty kill that limits high-danger chances and doesn't give up easy goals. Boston's power play has been feast or famine, and against a structured PK like New York's, they're more likely to come up empty. On the flip side, if the Islanders get power play opportunities, they've been efficient at home and on the road converting with their top units.</p>
        <p>Road professionalism: The Islanders are a veteran team that plays the same game whether they're home or away. They don't get caught up in the atmosphere, they stick to their system, and they grind out wins through discipline and execution. Boston has been vulnerable at home when teams take away their speed game and force them into physical, grinding matchups.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: The Islanders keep this game low-scoring and tight through the first two periods. They limit Boston's transition chances, force turnovers in the neutral zone, and capitalize on one or two quality scoring opportunities. Even if the Bruins push in the third, New York's defensive structure and goaltending hold firm. The Islanders win a one-goal game, and the -145 price cashes.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The total is set at 5.5 with juice on the Over at -120, which tells you the books expect scoring in this matchup but want to tax the public who will naturally lean toward goals. Both teams have the offensive firepower to push this total over, and their defensive vulnerabilities create the exact environment where six-plus goals becomes a reasonable outcome.</p>
        <p>Offensive firepower vs defensive leaks: Toronto's core—Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander—represents one of the highest-scoring trios in the NHL. They generate chances off the rush, punish mistakes, and convert on the power play at an elite rate. Calgary brings their own offensive weapons, particularly on transition and when they can get their skilled forwards in space. Neither team prioritizes defensive structure over offensive aggression, which means both goaltenders will face high-danger chances throughout the night.</p>
        <p>Goaltending concerns: Toronto's goaltending has been inconsistent at home, especially when facing volume and quality chances. Calgary's netminding situation has been equally shaky on the road. When you pair below-average goaltending with elite offensive skill, the path to six total goals opens up quickly. Even if one goaltender stands on his head for stretches, the offensive talent on both sides will eventually break through.</p>
        <p>Special teams create bonus scoring: Both teams have dangerous power plays that can score in bunches. Toronto's PP runs through Matthews and Marner, creating one-timer opportunities and seam passes that are nearly impossible to defend. Calgary's PP has skilled shooters who can beat goaltenders clean. If each team gets two or three power play opportunities, at least one or two goals will come on the man advantage, pushing the total closer to seven.</p>
        <p>Pace and game script: This game sets up as an up-tempo, back-and-forth contest. Neither team wants to sit back and defend a one-goal lead—they both want to play with pace and generate offense. That style favors goals. Even if one team jumps ahead early, the trailing team has the firepower to respond quickly, keeping the game high-event and open.</p>
        <p>Home ice offense: Toronto scores at a high rate at home, where they get last change and can dictate matchups. Calgary has shown they can score on the road when given space. The combination of Toronto's home offensive prowess and Calgary's ability to trade chances creates a scenario where both teams contribute multiple goals.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: Toronto and Calgary trade goals in the first period, with the score sitting at 2-1 or 2-2 after twenty minutes. The second period sees more offensive chances, and by the end of regulation, we've seen six or seven total goals. Even if the third period tightens up, the damage has been done early, and the Over cashes comfortably.</p>

      <div class="hr"></div>
      <div class="m-body">
        <p>Market context: The Devils are getting +140 as road underdogs against Detroit, which feels like an overreaction to recent form. New Jersey has elite offensive talent—Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, Jesper Bratt—that can take over games when their transition game clicks. At +140, you're getting plus-money on a team that has legitimate win equity, and the price is too good to pass up even as a half-unit value play.</p>
        <p>Talent vs situation: The Devils' speed through the neutral zone creates odd-man rushes and high-danger scoring chances that few teams can match. When New Jersey gets their forecheck going and forces turnovers, they can score in bunches. Detroit has been inconsistent at home, and if the Red Wings make mistakes in their own end, the Devils will capitalize quickly. The offensive talent gap favors New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Goaltending variance works in our favor: At +140, you're betting on the upside case. If New Jersey gets a strong goaltending performance—which is entirely possible—and their offensive stars show up, this game flips from a toss-up to a Devils win. You don't need this to cash at a 60% clip to make it profitable. You just need the Devils to win outright once every three or four times at this price, and the talent suggests they'll hit that threshold.</p>
        <p>Detroit's defensive vulnerabilities: The Red Wings have struggled defensively at home, particularly when facing speed and skill on the rush. New Jersey's transition game is built to exploit exactly those weaknesses. If Detroit's defensemen get caught flat-footed or their forwards don't backcheck hard, the Devils will create breakaways and two-on-ones that lead to goals.</p>
        <p>Value over volume: This is a half-unit play because the risk is higher and the variance is real. But at +140, you're getting paid to take a shot on a talented team that's being undervalued by the market. Even if this loses more often than it wins, the times it cashes will more than make up for the losses when you're getting this kind of price.</p>
        <p>Path to the cover: New Jersey jumps out to an early lead with their speed game, forcing Detroit to play from behind. The Devils' goaltender makes a few key saves in the second period to preserve the lead, and New Jersey adds an insurance goal late. Even if Detroit pushes in the third, the Devils hold on for a one or two-goal win. The +140 price pays nicely on a narrow victory.</p>
        <p><b>The pick: New Jersey Devils +140 (0.5 Units)</b></p>
