                <p>I'll be honest with you. Fairleigh Dickinson Knights hosts Chicago St Cougars as a -3.5 favorite. It's a moderate spread that suggests home court advantage is a factor but this isn't expected to be a blowout.</p>

<p>The moneyline prices this as competitive: Fairleigh Dickinson Knights -182, Chicago St Cougars +150. In games priced this close, small edges matter. Home court, rest advantages, injury reports - all of it factors in.</p>
