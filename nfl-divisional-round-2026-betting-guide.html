<h1 class="article-title">NFL Divisional Round 2026: Complete Betting Guide</h1>
<div class="meta">Published: January 17, 2026 | NFL Playoffs | Updated Lines as of 9:00 AM ET</div>

<p>The Wild Card round delivered chaos. Four comeback wins in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter, the most ever in a single postseason weekend. Underdogs went 4-2 against the spread and won three games outright. If you thought the madness was over, think again.</p>

<p>The Divisional Round features four compelling matchups with fascinating betting angles. We have a potential shootout in Chicago, a defensive battle at Mile High, a revenge game in Seattle, and Drake Maye hosting his first playoff game. Let me break down every game with verified odds, key trends, and sharp betting angles.</p>

<h4>Wild Card Round Betting Recap</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Underdogs:</strong> 4-2 ATS, 3 outright wins</li>

<div class="game-card">
<h3>No. 6 Buffalo Bills at No. 1 Denver Broncos</h3>
<p class="game-meta">4:30 PM ET | CBS | Mile High Stadium</p>

<div class="odds-grid">
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Spread</div>
<div class="odds-value">BUF -1</div>
</div>
<div class="odds-item">

<div class="odds-label">Moneyline</div>
<div class="odds-value">BUF -115</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="analysis">
<p>The line that makes you do a double take. The 14-3 Broncos, who earned the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage throughout, are underdogs in their own building. That tells you everything about how the market views Josh Allen.</p>

<p>Buffalo (12-5) rolled into the playoffs with Allen putting up a herculean effort against Jacksonville in the Wild Card round. When the game is on the line, there might not be a more dangerous player in football. The Bills have won 8 of their last 10 and Allen is playing at an MVP level.</p>

<p>Denver earned that No. 1 seed with one of the NFL's best defenses, allowing just 18.3 points per game during the regular season. The altitude factor at Mile High is real, and the Broncos have been dominant at home. But here is the issue: can their offense keep pace if Allen gets cooking?</p>

<div class="stat-highlight">
<strong>Key Stat:</strong> The Broncos allowed just 18.3 PPG during the regular season, third-best in the NFL. But they have not faced a quarterback like Josh Allen in a must-win game.
</div>

<p>The total of 45.5 feels right for a game with Denver's defense and Mile High's thin air creating opposite pressures. Sharp money has been on the UNDER, trusting Denver's defense to make enough stops.</p>

<h3>No. 6 San Francisco 49ers at No. 1 Seattle Seahawks</h3>
<p class="game-meta">8:00 PM ET | FOX | Lumen Field</p>

<div class="odds-grid">
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Spread</div>
<div class="odds-value">SEA -7.5</div>

<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Moneyline</div>
<div class="odds-value">SEA -320</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="analysis">
<p>This is the rubber match. San Francisco won at Seattle 17-13 in Week 1. Seattle returned the favor with a dominant 13-3 victory in the Bay Area in Week 18 to clinch the No. 1 seed and the division title. Now they meet with a trip to the NFC Championship on the line.</p>

<p>The 49ers are getting 7.5 points, and the public is all over it. San Francisco +7 is one of the most-bet spreads of the weekend. But here is the devastating blow the market might be underpricing: George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during the Wild Card win over Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Kittle was not just a tight end for San Francisco. He was the emotional engine, the blocking anchor, and the safety valve in the passing game. Losing him fundamentally changes what the 49ers can do offensively, especially in a hostile environment like Lumen Field.</p>

<div class="stat-highlight">
<strong>Injury Alert:</strong> George Kittle (Achilles tear) OUT for season. This is a massive loss that the spread may not fully reflect.
</div>

<p>Seattle at home, coming off a bye week essentially (Week 18 was a controlled game), with the 12th Man at full volume against a decimated San Francisco team. The Seahawks have covered 7.5 points comfortably in several home games this season.</p>

<h2>Sunday, January 18, 2026</h2>

<div class="game-card">
<h3>No. 5 Houston Texans at No. 2 New England Patriots</h3>
<p class="game-meta">3:00 PM ET | ESPN | Gillette Stadium</p>

<div class="odds-grid">
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Spread</div>
<div class="odds-value">NE -3</div>
</div>
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Total</div>
<div class="odds-value">O/U 40.5</div>
</div>
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Moneyline</div>
<div class="odds-value">NE -155</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="analysis">
<p>Drake Maye has arrived. The rookie quarterback was sensational in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more in the Wild Card win over the Chargers. New England is hosting a Divisional Round game for the first time since 2018, and the old dynasty vibes are creeping back.</p>

<p>Houston demolished Pittsburgh 30-6 in the Wild Card, but this is a completely different test. Gillette Stadium in January. A young quarterback who has already shown he belongs. A Patriots defense that held the Chargers to just 3 points.</p>

<p>The 40.5 total is the lowest on the board, and for good reason. Both defenses are capable of dominating, and the cold New England weather tends to suppress scoring. This has the feel of a 20-17 rock fight.</p>

<div class="stat-highlight">
<strong>Key Trend:</strong> The Patriots are 1-6 ATS when they have a rest advantage. That is a significant fade factor, but it is also potentially dated against a young team with different energy.
</div>

<p>Houston has the experience at quarterback with C.J. Stroud, but Maye has shown he will not be rattled. The home crowd advantage at Gillette is worth at least 3 points historically, which makes this line feel almost exactly right.</p>
</div>

<div class="verdict">
<div class="verdict-label">Lean</div>
<div class="verdict-pick">Patriots -3 | UNDER 40.5</div>

<div class="game-card">
<h3>No. 5 Los Angeles Rams at No. 2 Chicago Bears</h3>
<p class="game-meta">6:30 PM ET | NBC | Soldier Field</p>

<div class="odds-grid">
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Spread</div>
<div class="odds-value">LAR -3.5</div>
</div>
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Total</div>
<div class="odds-value">O/U 48.5</div>
</div>
<div class="odds-item">
<div class="odds-label">Moneyline</div>
<div class="odds-value">LAR -175</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="analysis">
<p>The highest total on the Divisional Round board at 48.5 tells you what the market expects: points. The Rams and Bears both have explosive offenses capable of lighting up the scoreboard, and neither defense has been particularly stingy.</p>

<p>This is Chicago's first home Divisional Round game in 15 years. Soldier Field will be electric. The Bears earned the No. 2 seed under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, who brought his Lions offensive magic to the Windy City. Caleb Williams has developed into the star everyone projected when he was drafted.</p>

<p>But there is a critical injury angle: Matthew Stafford's throwing hand. Reports of concern about his hand have trimmed the spread from Rams -4.5 to Rams -3.5 in the first 12 hours of action. That is a significant move on injury news, and it suggests the market is not fully confident Stafford is 100%.</p>

<div class="stat-highlight">
<strong>Line Movement Alert:</strong> Rams opened -4.5, now -3.5. Matthew Stafford hand concern driving the move. Sharp money should monitor injury reports closely.
</div>

<p>If Stafford is healthy, the Rams have the playoff pedigree and Sean McVay's coaching edge. If he is compromised, the Bears at home with a crowd advantage could steal this game outright. The 48.5 total suggests both offenses will operate, making this the shootout of the weekend.</p>
</div>

<div class="verdict">
<div class="verdict-label">Lean</div>
<div class="verdict-pick">Bears +3.5 | OVER 48.5</div>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Sharp Betting Angles</h2>

<h3>The Underdog Value Play</h3>
<p>Wild Card round underdogs went 4-2 ATS. The market tends to overcorrect toward favorites in the Divisional Round, creating value on dogs. San Francisco +7.5 (most-bet spread) and Chicago +3.5 are getting significant public action for a reason.</p>

<h3>The Weather Factor</h3>
<p>Denver's altitude. New England's cold. Chicago's wind off Lake Michigan. Three of four games feature environmental factors that historically suppress scoring. The UNDER has been the sharp side on most of these totals.</p>

<h3>The Injury Wildcards</h3>
<p>George Kittle done for San Francisco. Matthew Stafford's hand questionable for LA. These are the X-factors that could swing games. Injury-adjusted spreads suggest Seattle should be laying closer to -10 without Kittle, meaning -7.5 might actually be value on the home team.</p>

<div class="trends-box">
<h4>Divisional Round Historical Trends</h4>
<ul>
<li>Home teams are 24-8 ATS in Divisional Round games since 2020</li>
<li>Favorites of 7+ points are 12-4 straight up but only 8-8 ATS</li>
<li>Divisional Round totals have hit the UNDER 58% of the time over the last 5 seasons</li>
<li>Teams coming off bye weeks are 7-1 straight up but only 4-4 ATS</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Best Bets Summary</h2>

<p>The Divisional Round offers four distinct betting profiles. Buffalo-Denver is the clash of Allen's brilliance versus Denver's defense. Seattle-San Francisco is an injury-adjusted mismatch that the market may be underpricing. New England-Houston is a defensive rock fight with a low total. And Rams-Bears is the potential shootout with injury uncertainty on one side.</p>

<p>Trust the defenses in three of four games. Trust the environment factors. And be cautious about laying big numbers with injury question marks. The Wild Card round reminded us that underdogs are live in January. Do not be afraid to take the points.</p>
