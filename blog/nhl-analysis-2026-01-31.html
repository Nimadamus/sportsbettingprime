        <h1>NHL Betting Analysis - January 31, 2026</h1>
        <p class="meta">Saturday, January 31, 2026 | Sports Betting Prime | 12-Game Slate</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>A loaded Saturday NHL slate features 12 games with some massive storylines. Nathan MacKinnon can become the first player to reach 40 goals this season when Colorado visits Detroit on ABC. The Sabres continue their historic run (20-3-1 since Dec. 9), the Rangers-Penguins rivalry reignites, and the Hurricanes look to extend their hot streak against Washington. Here's where the betting value lies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis headline-game">
            <h3>⭐ Colorado Avalanche @ Detroit Red Wings</h3>
            <p class="game-time">1:00 PM ET | Little Caesars Arena | ABC</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">COL -1.5 (+145)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 6.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">COL -155 / DET +130</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>This is the headline matchup of Saturday's slate for good reason. Nathan MacKinnon enters with 39 goals and can become the first player to hit 40 this season. The Avalanche offense is firing on all cylinders, averaging 3.6 goals per game, and MacKinnon-Rantanen-Makar is the most dangerous top unit in hockey.</p>
                <p>Detroit has been playing better hockey lately but remains inconsistent. Patrick Kane's historic achievement (passing Mike Modano as the all-time leading U.S.-born scorer) adds some energy, but the Red Wings are just 12-14-3 at home. Their defensive structure gives up too many odd-man rushes.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Colorado is 8-2 in their last 10 games. The over is 6-4 in Avalanche road games this season.</div>
                <p>The Avalanche should dominate possession and create plenty of chances. MacKinnon will be motivated for the milestone. Colorado wins and the over cashes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Los Angeles Kings @ Philadelphia Flyers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">12:30 PM ET | Wells Fargo Center</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">PHI -1.5 (-290)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 5.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">LAK -110 / PHI -110</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>A true pick'em with both teams priced at -110. The Kings have been solid all season with Anze Kopitar providing veteran leadership and their goaltending tandem keeping them in games. LA's 3.1 goals per game offense is steady but not explosive.</p>
                <p>Philadelphia's young core is developing nicely, and the Flyers play hard at home. However, their defensive inconsistencies (3.2 goals allowed per game) make them vulnerable against patient teams like LA.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">The under is 6-4 in Kings road games. Philadelphia is 13-10-2 at home this season.</div>
                <p>This feels like a 3-2 or 2-1 type of game. Take the under 5.5 and look for value on the Kings moneyline if the number creeps toward +115.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>New York Rangers @ Pittsburgh Penguins</h3>
            <p class="game-time">3:30 PM ET | PPG Paints Arena</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">NYR -1.5 (-154)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 6.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">NYR -150 / PIT +126</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Metro Division rivalry renews with the Rangers looking to continue their climb up the standings. New York's defensive structure under Peter Laviolette has been excellent, and Igor Shesterkin remains one of the league's elite netminders.</p>
                <p>Pittsburgh is fighting to stay relevant in the playoff race. Sidney Crosby and the Penguins are 10-2 SU in their last 12 games and have found something. This is a dangerous spot for the Rangers as road favorites in a rivalry game.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">The Penguins are 10-2 SU in their last 12 games. The Rangers are 2-5 SU in their last 7 games against Pittsburgh.</div>
                <p>The value here is on Pittsburgh. The Penguins are playing their best hockey of the season and have dominated this matchup recently. Take the Pens +126 moneyline.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Carolina Hurricanes @ Washington Capitals</h3>
            <p class="game-time">5:00 PM ET | Capital One Arena</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">CAR -1.5 (+160)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 6.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">CAR -164 / WSH +136</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Hurricanes are scorching hot at 5-0-1 in their last six games, including a dramatic comeback where they scored three goals in the final 1:59 of regulation. Carolina's relentless forecheck and team speed make them one of the most dangerous teams in the league.</p>
                <p>Washington has been competitive but inconsistent. Alex Ovechkin continues his chase for Gretzky's all-time goals record, and the Capitals feed off his energy. However, their defensive lapses have cost them in key moments.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Carolina is 5-0-1 in their last 6 games. Washington is a +136 underdog at home.</div>
                <p>The Hurricanes' momentum is real. Carolina wins this one outright, and the puck line (+160) offers nice value if you trust them to pull away late.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Montreal Canadiens @ Buffalo Sabres</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | KeyBank Center | NHLN</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">BUF -1.5 (+180)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 6.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">BUF -132 / MTL +110</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Sabres have been the league's best story since early December. Their 20-3-1 run since December 9th has catapulted them into third place in the Atlantic Division. Buffalo's young core is finally putting it together, and the home crowd has been electric.</p>
                <p>Montreal is in rebuilding mode and struggles on the road (11-16-3). The Canadiens' defensive structure is porous, and they'll have trouble matching Buffalo's speed and energy in a hostile building.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Buffalo is 20-3-1 since December 9th, the best record in the NHL during that span. The Sabres are league-best at home (14-7-2).</div>
                <p>Ride the Sabres. They're playing with house money and their confidence is sky-high. Buffalo covers the puck line at home.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Florida Panthers @ Winnipeg Jets</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Canada Life Centre</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">WPG -1.5 (+155)</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 6.0</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The back-to-back Stanley Cup champion Panthers travel to Winnipeg for a Central Division test. Florida has been solid but not dominant this season, sitting comfortably in the playoff picture but not running away with anything.</p>
                <p>Winnipeg has been one of the league's best home teams, and their depth scoring has been excellent. The Jets play a physical, grinding style that can frustrate skilled teams.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Winnipeg is 18-8-2 at home this season. Florida is 13-11-4 on the road.</div>
                <p>The Jets at home are dangerous. Winnipeg wins a tight, low-scoring affair. Lean under 6.0 and Jets moneyline.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Minnesota Wild @ Edmonton Oilers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">10:00 PM ET | Rogers Place</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Puck Line</span><span class="odds-value">EDM -1.5 (+176)</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Oilers' dynamic duo of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl makes them dangerous in any matchup. Edmonton has been rolling at home (17-6-2), and their power play remains lethal at 28.4%.</p>
                <p>Minnesota plays structured hockey and won't give the Oilers easy looks. The Wild are 15-2 SU in their last 17 games in February historically, showing they perform well this time of year.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Edmonton is 17-6-2 at home. The over is 6-4 in Oilers home games.</div>
                <p>This should be an entertaining, high-paced affair. The over 6.5 is the play, and the Oilers win a 4-3 type game.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Seattle Kraken @ Vegas Golden Knights</h3>
            <p class="game-time">10:00 PM ET | T-Mobile Arena</p>

            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Vegas has added Mitch Marner (July 2025 trade from Toronto) and looks even more dangerous. The Golden Knights are built for the postseason, and their home-ice advantage at T-Mobile Arena is one of the league's best.</p>
                <p>Seattle has been a middle-of-the-pack team all season. The Kraken struggle to score consistently and don't have the star power to match Vegas's top lines.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Vegas is 16-5-3 at home this season. Seattle is 11-13-4 on the road.</div>
                <p>The Golden Knights should control this one from start to finish. Vegas covers the puck line at home.</p>
