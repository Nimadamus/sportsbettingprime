        <p class="meta">February 10, 2026 | Sports Betting Prime | Top 25 Matchups</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Tuesday night in college basketball is loaded. We've got 10 games involving ranked teams, including a monster Big Ten showdown between #13 Purdue and #7 Nebraska, #4 Duke traveling to Pitt, and #3 Houston looking to stay perfect on the road at Utah. Conference races are heating up and every game matters for seeding. Let's get into it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#13</span> Purdue Boilermakers @ <span class="ranked-badge">#7</span> Nebraska Cornhuskers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Pinnacle Bank Arena, Lincoln, NE | FS1</p>
            <div class="odds-box">Spread: Nebraska -2.5 | O/U: 147.5</div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>This is the game of the night. Two Big Ten heavyweights colliding in Lincoln with conference title implications on every possession. Nebraska (21-2) has been one of the best stories in college basketball this season, and their home record of 15-1 is a massive factor here. Pinnacle Bank Arena will be rocking.</p>
                <p>Purdue (19-4) brings the more polished offensive attack, shooting 51.1% from the field and scoring 83 points per contest as a team. The Boilermakers have the talent edge position by position, but their recent ATS record is concerning. They've gone just 1-4 against the spread in their last five, meaning the market has been overvaluing them. That's a red flag when you're laying points on the road.</p>
                <p>Nebraska counters as a team averaging 80 points per contest and a 47.3% clip from the field. More importantly, the Huskers are 4-0 ATS as underdogs this season, and they're 8-2 in their last 10 games straight up. Home court is real in the Big Ten, and 2.5 points is a razor-thin margin. Both teams have defensive weaknesses, which is why the total sits at a modest 147.5 despite both averaging 80+ per game. Expect this to be competitive down to the final minutes.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#11</span> North Carolina Tar Heels @ Miami Hurricanes</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Watsco Center, Coral Gables, FL | ESPN</p>
            <div class="odds-box">Spread: UNC -1.5 to -3.5 | O/U: 158.5-160</div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Tar Heels head to South Beach as slight road favorites, which immediately raises an eyebrow. ACC road games are brutal, and Watsco Center has historically been a tough place to play. The line is moving around quite a bit, sitting between 1.5 and 3.5 depending on where you shop, which tells you the market is uncertain about this one.</p>
                <p>North Carolina comes in ranked #11 and playing solid basketball, but this feels like a classic trap game. Miami has the athletes to match up, and the Hurricanes always play their best against ranked opponents at home. The total hovering around 159 suggests an up-tempo affair, which plays into Miami's hands.</p>
                <p>If you can get UNC at -1.5, it looks different than -3.5. That two-point swing matters enormously in a game projected to be decided by a possession or two. This is one where line shopping is the edge, not game analysis. Either way, expect a tight, physical ACC battle that goes down to the wire.</p>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#15</span> Virginia Cavaliers @ Florida State Seminoles</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Tucker Center, Tallahassee, FL | ESPNU</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Virginia (20-3) is quietly having one of the best seasons in the country, winners of four straight and playing elite defense as always. The Cavaliers' trademark pack-line defense makes every possession feel like a grind, and that's a nightmare for a Florida State team (11-12) that doesn't have the half-court execution to survive it.</p>
                <p>The Seminoles have won three straight, though, so don't completely write them off. Momentum matters in college basketball, and Tallahassee can be a tricky road environment. But there's a significant talent gap here, and Virginia's defensive identity travels well. The Cavaliers should control pace, limit possessions, and make this an ugly, low-scoring game that plays right into their hands.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#19</span> Vanderbilt Commodores @ Auburn Tigers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Neville Arena, Auburn, AL | SEC Network</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Vanderbilt has been one of the more pleasant surprises in the SEC this year, earning a #19 ranking. But traveling to Auburn's Neville Arena is a different beast entirely. The Tigers thrive on home energy, and the SEC is a war of attrition where road wins are a luxury, not an expectation.</p>
                <p>Auburn has the length and athleticism to disrupt Vandy's offensive flow, and the Tigers' ability to turn turnovers into transition points makes them dangerous even in games where they don't shoot well from the outside. Vanderbilt will need to protect the basketball and execute in the half-court to have a shot here. This game will tell us a lot about whether Vandy's ranking is real or inflated by schedule.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#22</span> BYU Cougars @ Baylor Bears</h3>
            <p class="game-time">7:00 PM ET | Foster Pavilion, Waco, TX | ESPN2</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>A massive Quad 1 game for both teams as BYU makes the trip to Waco. The Cougars come in ranked #22 and desperately need road wins to solidify their NCAA Tournament resume. Baylor, meanwhile, is fighting for its tournament life and will treat this like a must-win at home.</p>
                <p>Foster Pavilion is one of the tougher road venues in the Big 12, and Baylor's physicality inside can bother teams that rely on perimeter play. BYU has been efficient offensively all season but hasn't always shown they can win grind-it-out games on the road against physical defenses. This is the kind of game that separates pretenders from contenders. Expect a tight, competitive contest with both teams leaving everything on the floor.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#4</span> Duke Blue Devils @ Pittsburgh Panthers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">9:00 PM ET | Petersen Events Center, Pittsburgh, PA | ESPN</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Duke comes into this one as the #4 team in the country and one of the most dominant forces in college basketball. The Blue Devils demolished Pitt 76-47 in their last meeting and have been virtually untouchable in ACC play. But the Petersen Events Center is one of the trickiest road venues in the conference, and Tuesday night games in college hoops are always a little weird.</p>
                <p>The Panthers need a signature win to boost their tournament profile, and knocking off Duke at home would be exactly that. Pittsburgh will need to defend without fouling, force Duke into half-court sets, and win the rebounding battle to have any chance. Duke's depth and talent advantage should win out, but the question is by how much. If Pitt can keep this within single digits, they've done their job.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#3</span> Houston Cougars @ Utah Utes</h3>
            <p class="game-time">9:00 PM ET | Huntsman Center, Salt Lake City, UT | ESPN2</p>
            <div class="odds-box">Spread: Houston (heavy favorite) | ML: Houston -2040 / Utah +962</div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The moneyline tells you everything. Houston -2040 means you'd have to risk over $2,000 to win $100. That's how the market views this mismatch. The #3 Cougars are an absolute machine, 8-2 against the spread in their last 10 games, and their defense is among the best in college basketball by any metric you want to use.</p>
                <p>Utah is 6-4 ATS in their last 10, which means they've been competitive against the number even in tough spots. Playing at the Huntsman Center at elevation gives them a slight edge that pure talent doesn't account for. But Houston's defensive intensity and rebounding dominance are matchup nightmares for a Utah team that doesn't have the shot-creators to break down elite pressure.</p>
                <p>The Cougars will try to slow this down, control the glass, and suffocate Utah's offense into tough contested looks. Houston wins comfortably, but the altitude and home crowd could keep it closer than expected for 30 minutes.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#5</span> Iowa State Cyclones @ TCU Horned Frogs</h3>
            <p class="game-time">9:00 PM ET | Schollmaier Arena, Fort Worth, TX | FS1</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Iowa State (21-2, 8-2 Big 12) has been one of the most consistent teams in America, and their defensive identity makes them a nightmare to prepare for. The Cyclones force turnovers at an elite rate and turn those into easy transition buckets. For a TCU team (14-9, 4-6) fighting to stay on the right side of the bubble, this is a daunting matchup.</p>
                <p>TCU needs to protect the ball above all else. If the Horned Frogs can keep turnovers under 12, they have a chance to keep this competitive. Schollmaier Arena will be loud, and this is a meaningful game for TCU's tournament hopes, so expect maximum effort. But Iowa State's ability to ratchet up defensive intensity in the second half has been the difference all season. The Cyclones' 21-2 record speaks for itself.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#21</span> Arkansas Razorbacks @ LSU Tigers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">9:00 PM ET | Maravich Assembly Center, Baton Rouge, LA | SEC Network</p>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>SEC road games are nightmares, and the Maravich Assembly Center might be the most underrated venue in the conference. LSU's student section creates a hostile environment that has tripped up better teams than this. Arkansas comes in ranked #21 and looking to stack quality wins for tournament seeding, but Baton Rouge is not the place to take a deep breath.</p>
                <p>The Razorbacks have the offensive firepower to win anywhere, but their road defense has been inconsistent at times this season. LSU will try to speed this up and turn it into a track meet, playing to their athletes and length. If Arkansas can impose their tempo and get efficient half-court offense, they should have the talent to pull this out. But nothing is easy in the SEC on a Tuesday night.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3><span class="ranked-badge">#12</span> Gonzaga Bulldogs vs. Washington State Cougars</h3>
            <p class="game-time">11:00 PM ET | McCarthey Athletic Center, Spokane, WA | ESPN2</p>
            <div class="odds-box">Spread: Gonzaga -17.5 | ML: Gonzaga -2500 / Washington State +1050 | O/U: 154.5</div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The late-night special, and it's a mismatch on paper. Gonzaga -17.5 at home is one of the biggest spreads on any ranked team this season, and the -2500 moneyline says the Bulldogs are expected to win this in a rout. McCarthey Athletic Center is one of the best home courts in the country, and the Zags don't lose there.</p>
                <p>Washington State will try to slow the pace and grind this into an ugly, physical game. That's the only path for a double-digit underdog, make it as few possessions as possible and hope Gonzaga has an off shooting night. The 154.5 total reflects that lower-possession expectation, but Gonzaga's talent should push through regardless.</p>
                <p>The question isn't whether Gonzaga wins, it's whether they care enough about covering 17.5 late in the second half. If Mark Few keeps the starters in, it's a cover. If the bench comes in early, Wazzu can backdoor their way to covering. That's the only bet here.</p>
