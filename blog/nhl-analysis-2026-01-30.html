        <div class="intro">
            <p>Light night in the NHL with just one game on the schedule. The Columbus Blue Jackets head to Chicago to take on the Blackhawks in what shapes up to be a battle of two teams in very different places. Columbus has been a pleasant surprise this season while Chicago continues their long rebuild.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Columbus Blue Jackets @ Chicago Blackhawks</h3>
            <p class="game-time">8:30 PM ET | NHL Network</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <span>Puck Line:</span> Columbus -1.5 (+155) | <span>O/U:</span> 6.5 | <span>ML:</span> CBJ -155
            </div>

            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Blue Jackets come into Chicago as road favorites, which tells you everything about where these franchises currently stand. Columbus has been one of the more surprising teams in the Eastern Conference this season, building on the foundation laid in recent drafts. Meanwhile, the Blackhawks remain mired in their rebuild, with Connor Bedard as the lone bright spot.</p>

                <h4>Columbus Blue Jackets</h4>
                <p>The Blue Jackets have exceeded expectations this season behind solid goaltending and a young core that's starting to gel. Their road record has been respectable, and they've been particularly strong in games against bottom-tier teams. The power play has been clicking lately, converting at over 22% in January, and their penalty kill ranks in the top half of the league.</p>

                <p>Patrik Laine's return from injury has provided the offensive spark this team needed. When healthy, he's still one of the most dangerous shooters in the league. Johnny Gaudreau continues to rack up assists, and the blue line has been surprisingly stout with Zach Werenski anchoring the top pair.</p>

                <h4>Chicago Blackhawks</h4>
                <p>Let's be honest: Chicago is in full tank mode. They're accumulating assets, developing young players, and positioning themselves for another high draft pick. Bedard has been electric when healthy, but one player can't carry an entire franchise. The goaltending has been inconsistent at best, and the defensive structure leaves much to be desired.</p>

                <p>The Blackhawks have struggled mightily at home this season, which seems counterintuitive given the United Center's history. But this roster just doesn't have the depth to compete night in and night out. They'll have their moments, especially with Bedard capable of taking over a game, but consistency is nowhere to be found.</p>

                <h4>The Betting Angle</h4>
                <p>Columbus -155 on the moneyline is the safest play here. The Blue Jackets are the better team in nearly every measurable category, and Chicago hasn't given bettors reason to trust them. The puck line at +155 is tempting but carries risk, as these types of games can stay close even when the better team controls play.</p>

                <p>The 6.5 total is interesting. Columbus has the offensive firepower to hit four or five goals against Chicago's porous defense, but the Blue Jackets' own goaltending has been solid enough to keep goals against in check. Both teams have shown they can be involved in high-scoring affairs, so the over might have slight value, but it's close to a coin flip.</p>

                    <div class="stat-box">
                        <h5>Columbus Blue Jackets</h5>
                        <p>Goals For: 3.1/game</p>
                        <p>Goals Against: 2.9/game</p>
                        <p>PP%: 22.4%</p>
                        <p>PK%: 79.8%</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-box">
                        <h5>Chicago Blackhawks</h5>
                        <p>Goals For: 2.4/game</p>
                        <p>Goals Against: 3.4/game</p>
                        <p>PP%: 17.2%</p>
                        <p>PK%: 76.1%</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h4>Historical Note</h4>
                <p>Patrick Kane made history yesterday, recording his 1,375th career point to become the all-time leading American-born scorer, passing Mike Modano. The former Blackhawks legend continues to add to his legacy in Detroit. Chicago fans will forever appreciate what Kane meant to this franchise, even as they watch from the other side of a rebuild he was smart enough to avoid.</p>

                <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
                <p>This should be a comfortable Columbus victory. The Blue Jackets are the better team, they're motivated, and Chicago hasn't shown the ability to hang with competent opponents. Take Columbus on the moneyline and consider the over if you're feeling aggressive.</p>
