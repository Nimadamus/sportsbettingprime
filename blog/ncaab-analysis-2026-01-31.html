        <div class="intro">
            <p>To say there's a lot of college basketball being played today is an understatement. Saturday's slate features 40+ games with conference play in full swing across every major conference. Duke travels to Virginia Tech, Cincinnati visits Houston in a Big 12 showdown, and the Bedlam rivalry renews with Texas at Oklahoma. Here's where the smart money is heading.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis headline-game">
            <h3>⭐ Cincinnati Bearcats @ Houston Cougars</h3>
            <p class="game-time">12:00 PM ET | Fertitta Center | FOX</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">HOU -8.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 132.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">HOU -380 / CIN +295</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Cougars are one of the nation's best defensive teams, holding opponents to just 62.8 PPG (6th nationally). Kelvin Sampson's program doesn't rebuild, it reloads, and this year's squad is as suffocating as ever. Houston leads the Big 12 in adjusted defensive efficiency.</p>
                <p>Cincinnati has been solid but struggles on the road in hostile environments. The Bearcats are 4-6 away from home and shoot just 42.3% from the field in road games. Houston's length and physicality will bother Cincy's guards.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Houston is 16-2 at home and covers at a 67% clip as home favorites of 7+. The under is 8-4 in Cougars home games.</div>
                <p>This has all the makings of an ugly, low-scoring defensive battle. Houston grinds out a 68-55 type win. Take the under and Houston to cover.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Texas Tech Red Raiders @ UCF Knights</h3>
            <p class="game-time">11:00 AM ET | Addition Financial Arena | ESPN2</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">TTU -4.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 136.5</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Texas Tech's defense remains elite under Grant McCasland, holding opponents to 41.2% shooting (12th nationally). The Red Raiders don't have the offensive firepower of previous years, but they grind teams into submission.</p>
                <p>UCF has been up and down in their first Big 12 season. The Knights are 9-7 at home but struggle against elite defensive teams. Their 3-point shooting (34.1%) goes cold in games like this.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Texas Tech is 6-2 ATS as road favorites this season. UCF is 3-7 ATS as home underdogs.</div>
                <p>Tech's defensive identity travels well. The Red Raiders cover in a 64-57 grinder.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Duke Blue Devils @ Virginia Tech Hokies</h3>
            <p class="game-time">12:00 PM ET | Cassell Coliseum | ESPN</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">DUKE -6.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 145.5</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Jon Scheyer's Blue Devils are playing their best basketball of the season, with a balanced attack that features multiple scoring threats. Duke's freshman class has developed nicely, and their transition offense is among the nation's best.</p>
                <p>Virginia Tech has been feisty at home but lacks the talent to hang with elite programs for 40 minutes. Cassell Coliseum can be hostile, but Duke has the depth and poise to handle the environment.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Duke is 9-3 ATS in true road games this season. Virginia Tech is 4-8 ATS as home underdogs against Top 25 teams.</div>
                <p>Duke's talent advantage is significant. The Blue Devils pull away in the second half and cover the 6.5.</p>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Marquette Golden Eagles @ Seton Hall Pirates</h3>
            <p class="game-time">12:00 PM ET | Prudential Center | NBCSN/Peacock</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">MARQ -7.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 144.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">MARQ -320 / SHU +255</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Marquette is a Big East title contender with one of the league's most efficient offenses. Shaka Smart has built a program that plays fast, shares the ball, and makes threes at an elite clip (37.8%).</p>
                <p>Seton Hall has struggled for consistency all season. The Pirates' offense sputters in big games, and they don't have the perimeter shooting to keep up with Marquette in a track meet.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Marquette is 12-4 ATS this season. Seton Hall is 2-8 ATS in their last 10 games against ranked opponents.</div>
                <p>The Golden Eagles should control this one from the opening tip. Marquette covers comfortably.</p>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Ohio State Buckeyes @ Wisconsin Badgers</h3>
            <p class="game-time">2:00 PM ET | Kohl Center | FOX</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">WISC -4.5</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>Wisconsin's methodical offense and stingy defense make them tough to beat at the Kohl Center. The Badgers rank 15th in adjusted defensive efficiency and force teams into uncomfortable possessions.</p>
                <p>Ohio State has talent but lacks consistency. The Buckeyes are just 5-7 on the road this season and shoot poorly (41.8%) away from Columbus. Wisconsin's patient approach will exploit OSU's defensive lapses.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Wisconsin is 13-3 at home and 8-4 ATS as home favorites. The under is 6-3 in Badgers home games.</div>
                <p>Greg Gard's team grinds out another home victory. Take Wisconsin and the under in a 66-60 type game.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-analysis">
            <h3>Texas Longhorns @ Oklahoma Sooners</h3>
            <p class="game-time">4:00 PM ET | Lloyd Noble Center | ESPN2</p>
            <div class="odds-box">
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Spread</span><span class="odds-value">TEX -3.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Total</span><span class="odds-value">O/U 140.5</span></div>
                <div class="odds-item"><span class="odds-label">Moneyline</span><span class="odds-value">TEX -165 / OU +140</span></div>
            </div>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Bedlam rivalry continues in basketball, and these games are always emotionally charged. Texas has the more talented roster and plays elite defense, but Oklahoma's home crowd will be electric for this one.</p>
                <p>The Sooners have been scrappy in SEC play but struggle to score against elite defenses. Texas's length and athleticism cause problems for Oklahoma's guards.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Texas is 7-4 ATS as road favorites. Oklahoma is 6-5 ATS as home underdogs this season.</div>
                <p>Rivalry games are unpredictable, but talent usually wins out. Texas covers the short number.</p>

            <h3>Arizona Wildcats @ Arizona State Sun Devils</h3>
            <p class="game-time">6:00 PM ET | Desert Financial Arena | TNT/truTV</p>
            <div class="odds-box">

            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>The Territorial Cup rivalry is always heated, and Arizona State will be fired up at home. Tommy Lloyd's Wildcats are the more talented team, but rivalry games at Desert Financial Arena are always tricky.</p>
                <p>Arizona State has been competitive in Big 12 play and defends well enough to keep games close. The Sun Devils are 8-5 at home and play with energy in front of their crowd.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">Arizona is 5-6 ATS as road favorites. Arizona State is 6-4 ATS at home this season.</div>
                <p>This feels like a 4-5 point game. Take Arizona State +5.5 in a rivalry where the home team usually covers.</p>

            <h3>North Carolina Tar Heels @ Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</h3>
            <p class="game-time">6:00 PM ET | McCamish Pavilion | ACC Network</p>

            <div class="analysis-content">
                <p>North Carolina's up-tempo offense can overwhelm lesser opponents, and Georgia Tech qualifies as such. The Tar Heels push pace aggressively and rank top-15 nationally in transition scoring.</p>
                <p>Georgia Tech is in the middle of a difficult rebuild. The Yellow Jackets struggle to score (68.2 PPG) and don't have the athletes to run with Carolina in the open floor.</p>
                <div class="key-stat">UNC is 11-3 ATS as favorites of 8+ points. Georgia Tech is 3-9 ATS as home underdogs.</div>

                <p>Louisville is in year two of their rebuild under Pat Kelsey and playing better basketball. The Cardinals' home crowd can get loud, and they've been competitive against quality opponents.</p>
