        <h1>Super Bowl LX Betting Preview: Patriots vs Seahawks - The Ultimate Betting Breakdown</h1>
        <p class="meta">February 2, 2026 | Sports Betting Prime | Super Bowl LX Analysis</p>

        </div>

        <p>In six days, two of the most compelling stories of the 2025 NFL season will collide at Levi's Stadium. The Patriots, who completed the greatest single-season turnaround in NFL history, face a Seahawks team that has been the betting favorite to win it all since mid-November. This is a Super Bowl rematch from XLIX, and the betting market is telling us some fascinating things.</p>

        <p>Let's dive into the numbers, the narratives, and the angles that matter most for bettors.</p>

            <p>The spread opened at Seahawks -3.5 and quickly moved to -4.5 within minutes of the conference championship games ending. The total has dropped a full point from 46.5 to 45.5.</p>

            <p><span class="key-stat"><strong>Total Action:</strong> 64% tickets on Under, 60% money on Over</span></p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Quarterback Duel: Maye vs Darnold</h2>

        <p>This is where the game will be won or lost. Drake Maye and Sam Darnold have combined to win 33 games as starting QBs this season, the most combined wins by two Super Bowl starting quarterbacks in NFL history.</p>

        <div class="qb-comparison">
            <div class="qb-card">
                <h4>Drake Maye - Patriots</h4>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>4,394</strong> passing yards</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>72.0%</strong> completion (NFL leader)</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>31 TD</strong> / 8 INT</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>113.5</strong> passer rating (NFL leader)</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>450</strong> rushing yards, 4 rush TD</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>8.9</strong> yards/attempt (NFL leader)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="qb-card">
                <h4>Sam Darnold - Seahawks</h4>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>4,048</strong> passing yards</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>67.7%</strong> completion</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>25 TD</strong> / 14 INT</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>99.1</strong> passer rating</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>14-3</strong> record (2nd ever after Brady)</p>
                <p class="qb-stat"><strong>470 yds</strong>, 4 TD, 0 INT in playoffs</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The numbers favor Maye significantly. He led the NFL in completion percentage, passer rating, and yards per attempt. He's a legitimate MVP candidate in just his second season. But Darnold has been ice cold when it matters, throwing four touchdowns with zero interceptions in the playoffs while playing through an oblique injury.</p>

        <h2>The Historic Narratives</h2>

        <div class="game-card">
            <h3>Patriots: The Greatest Turnaround in NFL History</h3>
            <p>New England went from 4-13 in 2024 to 14-3 in 2025, a +10 win improvement that ties the all-time record set by the 1999 Colts and 2008 Dolphins. The difference? Neither of those teams made the Super Bowl. The Patriots did.</p>
            <p>Mike Vrabel's arrival transformed this franchise. Drake Maye went from promising rookie to MVP candidate. This is the Patriots' first Super Bowl appearance since the Brady-Belichick dynasty ended, and they're seeking a record seventh Lombardi Trophy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-card">
            <h3>Seahawks: The Darnold Redemption Tour</h3>
            <p>Remember when Sam Darnold was considered a bust? After his breakout Pro Bowl season in Minnesota, Seattle signed him to replace Geno Smith, and the results have been remarkable. Darnold became just the second QB ever to post back-to-back 14-win seasons, joining Tom Brady.</p>
            <p>The Seahawks are seeking their second Super Bowl title and fourth appearance. The last time they faced the Patriots in the Super Bowl? That heartbreaking goal-line interception in XLIX.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Super Bowl Betting Trend That Should Scare Seahawks Backers</h2>

        <div class="trend-box">
            <h4>Underdogs in Recent Super Bowls</h4>
            <p><span class="key-stat"><strong>Last 5 Super Bowls:</strong> Underdogs 4-1 ATS</span></p>
            <p><span class="key-stat"><strong>Last 3 Super Bowls:</strong> Underdogs 3-0 outright</span></p>
            <p><span class="key-stat"><strong>Since 2007:</strong> Underdogs 13-5 ATS (72.2%)</span></p>
            <p><span class="key-stat"><strong>Since 2007:</strong> Underdogs 11-7 outright (61.1%)</span></p>
        </div>

        <p>This is the elephant in the room for anyone backing Seattle at -4.5. The market has consistently overvalued Super Bowl favorites over the past two decades. When a game is this highly anticipated, when both teams are this evenly matched, laying 4.5 points historically has not been a winning strategy.</p>

        <h2>Key Matchup Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Patriots Offense vs Seahawks Defense</h3>
        <p>Seattle's defense has been opportunistic all season, but Drake Maye doesn't turn the ball over. His 8 interceptions in 17 regular season games is exceptional, and his playoff numbers (4 TD, 2 INT through three games) show a quarterback who can manage the moment.</p>

        <h3>Seahawks Offense vs Patriots Defense</h3>
        <p>Darnold's 14 interceptions are concerning against a Patriots defense that has feasted on turnovers. However, his playoff performance, four touchdowns and zero picks, suggests he's elevated his game when stakes are highest.</p>

        <div class="injury-alert">
            <h4>Injury Watch: Drake Maye (Shoulder)</h4>
            <p>Maye missed Friday's practice due to illness following limited practices Wednesday and Thursday due to a shoulder injury. Both Maye and coach Mike Vrabel have downplayed the severity. This bears monitoring but is not expected to affect his Super Bowl availability.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Total Analysis: Why the Under Is Getting Action</h2>

        <p>The total dropping from 46.5 to 45.5 despite 60% of the money being on the Over tells you where the sharp action is. Here's why:</p>

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px; color: #cbd5e1;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Super Bowl defenses typically rise to the occasion</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Two-week preparation allows for extensive game-planning</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Both teams have shown they can win ugly this postseason</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Neutral site removes any home field offensive advantage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Super Bowl XLIX Rematch Context</h2>

        <p>The last time these teams met in a Super Bowl, Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson at the goal line with seconds remaining. That play defined a decade of Patriots dominance. Now the roles feel reversed, with Seattle as the favorite and New England as the underdog with something to prove.</p>

        <p>The Patriots players and staff have mentioned the history. There's a revenge narrative brewing, even if most of the current roster wasn't there for XLIX.</p>

        <div class="bottom-line">
            <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
            <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The Patriots at +4.5 represent significant value given the underdog trends in recent Super Bowls. Drake Maye is playing at an elite level, and this game profiles closer to a pick'em than a 4.5-point spread.</p>
            <p><strong>Total:</strong> The under at 45.5 aligns with sharp money. Both defenses will be prepared after two weeks, and big games often play tighter than regular season matchups.</p>
            <p><strong>Moneyline:</strong> Patriots +190 is worth a look for bettors comfortable with variance. This is not a game where the favorite should be laying -230.</p>
            <p>The market wants to believe in the Seahawks' season-long dominance, but the betting trends, quarterback play, and historical patterns all point to a closer game than the line suggests.</p>
