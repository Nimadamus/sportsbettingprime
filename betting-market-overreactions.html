    <h1>Betting Market Overreactions</h1>
    <p class="lead">Betting markets are remarkably efficient at aggregating information and producing accurate probability estimates. But they are not perfect. Under certain conditions, markets overshoot, pricing events based on emotion, recency, or incomplete processing rather than cold probability. Understanding when and why overreactions happen, what distinguishes them from legitimate repricing, and how markets self-correct is fundamental to understanding market mechanics.</p>

    <h2 id="what-overreaction-is">1. What Market Overreaction Actually Is</h2>

    <p>A market overreaction occurs when the price of an event moves further than the underlying change in true probability warrants. The key word is "further." Every piece of new information should cause some price adjustment. When a starting pitcher is scratched, the line should move. When a star player is ruled out, the spread should shift. Overreaction does not mean the line moved. It means the line moved too much, overshooting the new fair price and creating a temporary mispricing that will eventually be corrected.</p>

    <p>This distinction is critical because many observers label any significant price move as an "overreaction" without considering whether the magnitude of the move was actually disproportionate to the magnitude of the information. A 3-point spread move when an MVP-caliber quarterback is ruled out is not an overreaction. It is a rational repricing of a game whose expected outcome has genuinely shifted by approximately that amount. An overreaction would be a 6-point move on the same news, where the market has priced the quarterback's absence as twice as impactful as it actually is.</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Key Concept: Overreaction vs. Reaction</h4>
        <p>Every market move in response to new information is a reaction. Overreaction occurs only when the magnitude of the move exceeds the actual change in true probability. The line between appropriate reaction and overreaction is not always obvious in real time, and identifying it requires understanding the true impact of the underlying event, not just the direction of the move.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Overreactions are temporary by nature. If a market permanently prices an event incorrectly, the error would be a systematic bias, not an overreaction. The defining characteristic of an overreaction is that the market eventually corrects itself, with the price drifting back toward the true fair value after the initial overshoot. The correction may happen quickly (within minutes) or slowly (over hours or days), but it does happen. This self-correcting tendency is what distinguishes a functioning market from a broken one.</p>

    <p>It is also important to note that overreaction is only identifiable with certainty in hindsight. In real time, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between an overreaction (the line moved too far) and an accurate repricing that simply looks extreme. The information required to make this distinction, the true probability of the outcome under the new conditions, is precisely the information that no one possesses with certainty. This fundamental uncertainty is what allows overreactions to persist long enough to be meaningful.</p>

    <h2 id="recency-bias">2. Recency Bias in Line Setting</h2>

    <p>Recency bias is the cognitive tendency to overweight recent events relative to older data when forming expectations. In betting markets, this bias manifests when the market gives disproportionate weight to a team's most recent performance at the expense of longer-term fundamentals. A team that has won five straight might see its line inflated beyond what its season-long metrics justify. A team coming off two blowout losses might see its line deflated below its true level.</p>

    <p>The mechanism through which recency bias enters the market is primarily public betting behavior. The majority of betting volume comes from recreational bettors whose opinions are heavily influenced by what they watched most recently. If a team looked dominant on national television last Sunday, the public will bet that team more heavily the following week, regardless of whether the dominant performance was representative or anomalous. Sportsbooks, anticipating this one-directional public action, shade the line accordingly, and the result is a price that reflects recent narrative more than underlying probability.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example: Recency Bias After a Blowout</h4>
        <p>Team A defeats Team B by 35 points in a nationally televised game. The following week, Team A faces Team C, a solid but unspectacular opponent. The market prices Team A as a larger favorite than its season-long metrics would suggest, because the public saw the blowout and is eager to back Team A. The sportsbook, anticipating heavy public action on Team A, shades the line in that direction. The result is a spread that is 1.5 to 2.5 points wider than the pure probability estimate warrants. The blowout was real, but its influence on the following week's line exceeds its actual predictive value for the next game.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Recency bias is not limited to the public. Even sophisticated models can be susceptible if they weight recent games too heavily. A model that gives the last three games triple the weight of earlier games will overreact to hot and cold streaks that are, in part, random variance. The challenge for any pricing model is calibrating how quickly to adjust to new information without swinging too far on limited sample sizes. Get that calibration wrong in either direction, too slow to adjust or too fast, and the model will systematically misprice events.</p>

    <h3>Streaks and Mean Reversion</h3>

    <p>A significant portion of what the market identifies as "momentum" or "hot streaks" in sports is actually random variance that will naturally regress toward the mean. A basketball team that shoots 42% from three over a five-game stretch is probably experiencing positive variance rather than a permanent improvement in shooting ability. A baseball team that wins 12 of 15 games is probably benefiting from some combination of skill and favorable luck distribution that will not sustain at the same rate.</p>

    <p>When the market prices these streaks as if they represent permanent changes in team quality, it is overreacting to a transient phenomenon. The line reflects a world where the streak continues indefinitely, rather than a world where the team's true talent level reasserts itself over a larger sample. This creates a systematic pattern: teams coming off hot streaks tend to be slightly overpriced, and teams coming off cold streaks tend to be slightly underpriced, because the market incorporates recent results at a rate that exceeds their actual predictive value.</p>

    <h2 id="injury-overreaction">3. Overreaction to Injuries and News</h2>

    <p>Injuries are among the most common triggers for market overreaction. When a prominent player is ruled out, the market adjusts, but the magnitude of the adjustment frequently overshoots the player's actual impact on game outcome. This happens because injuries are visible, emotionally salient events that trigger immediate, intuitive reactions from both the public and sportsbooks.</p>

    <p>The overreaction to injuries has multiple contributing factors. First, the public tends to overestimate the importance of individual players, particularly high-profile stars whose absence generates media attention. The impact of losing a starting quarterback is real but not infinite. NFL teams have backup quarterbacks, game plans adjust, and opposing teams sometimes play differently against backups in ways that partially offset the talent drop-off. The market, driven by public sentiment, often prices the absence as more impactful than it actually is.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>The Replacement Level Problem</h4>
        <p>The true impact of an injury depends not on the absent player's absolute talent level but on the gap between the absent player and their replacement. Losing a superstar quarterback is less impactful if the backup is a competent veteran than if the backup is an undrafted rookie. The market often prices the absence of the star without adequately considering the capability of the replacement, leading to systematic overreaction on injuries to high-profile players with competent backups.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Second, the timing of injury news matters. Injuries announced close to game time trigger larger, more reflexive market moves than injuries announced early in the week. When news breaks ninety minutes before kickoff, the market has limited time to process the information carefully. The initial reaction tends to be large and blunt. If the same injury were known on Tuesday, the market would have five days to calibrate the adjustment, with bets from both informed and recreational bettors gradually finding the right price. Proximity to game time compresses this calibration process and makes overreaction more likely.</p>

    <p>Third, the market often fails to account for cascading effects of injuries. Removing one player changes the roles and responsibilities of every other player on the team. Sometimes these changes are positive: a backup who fits the game plan better than the starter, a tactical adjustment that exploits a different matchup. Sometimes they are negative: loss of leadership, disrupted chemistry, overreliance on remaining stars. The market's initial reaction to an injury typically captures only the direct talent loss, not the complex web of second-order effects that may partially offset or exacerbate it.</p>

    <h3>News Beyond Injuries</h3>

    <p>The same overreaction pattern applies to other forms of news: coaching changes, player suspensions, front-office drama, locker-room conflicts, and weather forecasts. Each of these can trigger market moves that exceed the actual impact on game probability. A coaching firing creates a "dead cat bounce" narrative that the market might overweight. A player suspension generates public sentiment that may inflate or deflate the line beyond what the player's actual on-field contribution warrants. A weather forecast showing rain causes the total to drop, but the magnitude of the drop often exceeds the actual historical impact of rain on scoring in that sport and venue.</p>

    <h2 id="public-sentiment">4. Public Sentiment Driving Prices Beyond True Probability</h2>

    <p>Public sentiment is arguably the single largest driver of overreaction in betting markets. The majority of money wagered on any event comes from recreational bettors whose opinions are shaped by narratives, media coverage, team loyalty, and recent results rather than by rigorous probability estimation. When public sentiment is strongly one-directional, it pushes prices away from true probability in predictable ways.</p>

    <p>The mechanism is straightforward. When 80% of the public money comes in on one side, the sportsbook faces a choice: hold the line and accept one-sided liability, or move the line to attract action on the other side. Most retail sportsbooks choose to move the line, and the resulting price reflects public demand more than it reflects the true probability of the outcome. The line becomes a compromise between what the market "should" be and what the sportsbook needs it to be to manage its own risk.</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Key Concept: Sentiment-Driven Pricing</h4>
        <p>When public sentiment overwhelmingly favors one side, the posted line reflects a blend of true probability and demand management. The more one-directional the public action, the more the posted price diverges from the price that would prevail in a market with only informed participants. This divergence is, by definition, an overreaction relative to pure probability.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Several factors amplify public sentiment's influence on pricing. Media coverage creates narratives that shape public perception. A team featured on ESPN's primetime broadcast will attract more public action the following week than a team that played in an unaired game, regardless of the actual quality of the two performances. National media creates a spotlight effect that inflates or deflates public perception beyond what the underlying facts justify.</p>

    <p>Brand-name teams attract disproportionate public action regardless of current form. Historically dominant franchises carry a "brand premium" in the betting market: the public backs them more heavily than their current performance warrants because of accumulated prestige and media coverage. This brand premium creates persistent overpricing of popular teams, which is one of the most well-documented patterns in sports betting markets.</p>

    <p>Social media has accelerated and amplified sentiment-driven pricing. A viral clip of a spectacular play, a trending narrative about a team's collapse, or a widely shared injury update can move public opinion faster than the market can process the actual informational content of the event. The speed of social media often outpaces the speed of careful analysis, creating windows where sentiment-driven betting flows push prices beyond what careful analysis would support.</p>

    <h3>The Primetime Effect</h3>

    <p>Games broadcast on national television attract substantially more public betting volume than games broadcast locally or regionally. This increased volume is predominantly one-directional, favoring the more popular team. The result is a systematic overpricing of popular teams in primetime spots. The line on a Monday Night Football game between a glamour team and a small-market opponent reflects not just the probability of the outcome but the anticipated flood of public money on the glamour team. This is a structural, repeatable form of sentiment-driven overreaction.</p>

    <h2 id="structural-causes">5. Structural Causes: Thin Markets and Information Asymmetry</h2>

    <p>Some overreactions are not caused by cognitive biases or public sentiment at all. They are caused by the structural characteristics of certain markets that make them inherently more prone to mispricing. Thin markets and information asymmetry are the two most important structural causes of overreaction.</p>

    <h3>Thin Markets</h3>

    <p>A thin market is one with limited trading volume, limited analytical attention, and limited pricing confidence. In thin markets, individual bets have outsized impact on the line because there is less countervailing action to absorb and offset them. A single bet from a respected account that would barely move the line in an NFL game might move the line a full point or more in a college basketball mid-major game. This magnified impact means that any misinformed or sentiment-driven bet has a larger effect on the posted price in thin markets than in deep ones.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example: Thin Market Overreaction</h4>
        <p>A mid-major college basketball total is posted at 138.5. A single sharp bet of $2,000 on the over pushes the line to 140. In an NBA game, $2,000 would not move the total at all. In this thin market, the bet represents a significant portion of total expected volume, and the sportsbook reacts accordingly. But the sharp bettor's opinion, while informed, is based on limited data for a game that has received minimal analytical attention. The line may have moved further than the quality of the underlying analysis actually warrants. The market is overreacting not because anyone is irrational, but because the structural thinness of the market amplifies the impact of each individual bet.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Thin markets are also slow to self-correct because the same lack of volume that causes the initial overshoot also means there are fewer informed participants to push the price back toward fair value. In a deep NFL market, an overreaction is typically corrected within minutes as dozens of sophisticated bettors recognize the mispricing and bet against it. In a thin college basketball market, the same overreaction might persist for hours or even through closing because there simply are not enough informed participants paying attention.</p>

    <h3>Information Asymmetry</h3>

    <p>Information asymmetry occurs when one side of the market has access to relevant information that the other side lacks. In sports betting, this can take many forms: non-public injury information, insider knowledge of lineup decisions, advanced data that is not widely available, or even superior local knowledge about weather conditions at a specific venue.</p>

    <p>When the market detects (or suspects) information asymmetry, it tends to overreact in the direction of the perceived informed side. A sudden bet from a known sharp account causes the line to move not just by the amount that the bet's size would imply, but by an additional "information premium" that reflects the book's belief that the bettor knows something. This information premium can cause the line to overshoot the actual new fair value, creating an overreaction. The sportsbook is not wrong to respect the informed action. It is sometimes wrong about the magnitude of the information advantage.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>The Phantom Sharp Move</h4>
        <p>Not every sharp bet reflects genuine private information. Sometimes respected accounts are wrong, betting on false signals or noise. But the market reacts to these bets as if they contain information regardless, because the sportsbook cannot distinguish a well-informed sharp bet from a poorly-informed one in real time. This creates a category of overreaction where the market moves on perceived information that does not actually exist.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="overreaction-vs-repricing">6. Overreaction vs. Legitimate Repricing</h2>

    <p>One of the most common analytical errors when studying betting markets is labeling every large price move as an "overreaction." Many large moves are entirely legitimate repricing in response to genuinely significant information. Distinguishing between overreaction and appropriate repricing requires a framework for evaluating the proportionality of market moves to their underlying causes.</p>

    <p>Legitimate repricing occurs when the magnitude of the price move is proportional to the actual change in expected outcome probability. When a team's franchise quarterback tears his ACL during warm-ups and the backup is a career third-stringer with no NFL starts, a 5-7 point move on the spread is not an overreaction. It is an accurate, perhaps even insufficient, adjustment to a genuinely catastrophic piece of information. The game has fundamentally changed, and the line should reflect that.</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Key Concept: The Proportionality Test</h4>
        <p>The test for overreaction is proportionality: did the line move further than the underlying event warrants? To answer this question, you need an independent estimate of the event's actual impact, which requires analytical capability beyond simply observing the move itself. Without an independent estimate, you cannot distinguish overreaction from appropriate repricing.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Several heuristics can help distinguish overreaction from legitimate repricing, even without a perfect independent model. First, consider the reversal pattern: if a line moves sharply in one direction and then drifts back over the following hours, the initial move likely overshot (overreaction). If the line moves sharply and holds or continues in the same direction, the initial move was likely appropriate or even insufficient (legitimate repricing). Second, consider the information source: moves driven by verified factual information (confirmed injuries, official lineup changes) are more likely legitimate than moves driven by rumors, speculation, or public sentiment. Third, consider the market depth: overreactions are more common in thin markets and less common in deep markets, because deep markets have more participants to quickly correct mispricing.</p>

    <h3>The Gray Zone</h3>

    <p>In practice, the boundary between overreaction and legitimate repricing is a gray zone, not a bright line. Many market moves fall somewhere between "clearly proportional" and "clearly excessive." A 3-point move that should have been 2.5 points is technically an overreaction, but the margin of error is so small that calling it an overreaction obscures more than it illuminates. The most useful identification of overreaction focuses on cases where the magnitude of the move is substantially disproportionate to the underlying information, not cases where the move is slightly more or less than optimal.</p>

    <h2 id="sport-specific">7. How Overreactions Manifest Differently by Sport</h2>

    <p>The frequency, magnitude, and type of overreaction vary significantly between sports. Each sport's structure, data availability, game frequency, and public following create distinct overreaction patterns.</p>

    <h3>Football (NFL and College)</h3>

    <p>Football is the sport most prone to overreaction, for several structural reasons. First, the sample size is small. NFL teams play only 17 regular-season games, and college teams play 12-13. With so few data points, each game carries enormous weight in public perception, and a single blowout win or loss can dramatically shift the narrative around a team. Second, football has the largest public betting handle, meaning more of the money in the market comes from sentiment-driven recreational bettors. Third, the weekly schedule gives the market an entire week to build narratives, hype matchups, and amplify storylines, creating maximum opportunity for sentiment to diverge from probability.</p>

    <p>In football, recency bias is particularly potent because last week's game is one of only sixteen or seventeen data points for the entire season. The market overweights individual games because there are so few of them, and each one represents a significant fraction of the total information available. A team that loses by 30 points in Week 3 sees its Week 4 line deflated by more than a single data point should warrant, because the market treats one game as roughly 6% of the total sample rather than placing it in the context of broader power ratings and historical performance.</p>

    <h3>Basketball (NBA and College)</h3>

    <p>Basketball markets are generally more efficient than football markets because of the higher game frequency (82 NBA games vs. 17 NFL games), which provides more data for pricing and more opportunities for the market to correct errors. However, basketball has its own overreaction patterns. The most prominent is overreaction to rest and scheduling. Back-to-back games, long road trips, and schedule spots that "look bad" on paper often trigger market overreaction. The public (and sometimes the models) overestimate the impact of fatigue and travel, particularly in an era when NBA teams actively manage rest through load management.</p>

    <p>In college basketball, overreaction is amplified by the vast number of teams and the limited analytical coverage most receive. Mid-major and low-major games are priced with less data, less model sophistication, and less corrective market activity than power-conference games. A mid-major team that upsets a ranked opponent might see its next line swing far beyond what the single upset result should warrant, simply because there is so little other data to anchor the pricing.</p>

    <h3>Baseball</h3>

    <p>Baseball is arguably the most efficient major sport for betting purposes, because its 162-game season provides massive sample sizes and its individual game outcomes are heavily influenced by the starting pitcher matchup, which is a known, quantifiable factor. However, baseball markets still overreact to certain stimuli. Streaks receive disproportionate weight: a team that has won eight straight sees its moneylines inflated beyond what the underlying run differential and pitching matchup justify. The market also overreacts to named-pitcher narratives, giving more weight to a pitcher's reputation than to their current-season peripheral statistics.</p>

    <h3>Hockey</h3>

    <p>Hockey markets are moderately efficient but prone to overreaction on goaltending. Starting goaltender announcements trigger line moves that sometimes exceed the actual gap in quality between the starter and the backup. This is exacerbated by small-sample goaltender statistics: a backup who has a .940 save percentage over 5 starts looks elite, but 5 starts is far too small a sample to draw reliable conclusions. The market prices these small samples as if they are representative, overreacting to variance that will almost certainly regress.</p>

    <h2 id="early-season">8. Early-Season Volatility and the Anchoring Problem</h2>

    <p>The beginning of any sports season is the period when overreaction is most frequent and most severe. This is because early in the season, the market is operating with minimal current-season data and is heavily reliant on preseason projections, which are inherently uncertain. Each early game represents a large fraction of the available sample, magnifying its impact on both public perception and model-based pricing.</p>

    <p>Anchoring bias compounds this problem. Preseason power ratings and win totals serve as anchors that the market adjusts from, but the adjustments are typically insufficient. If a team was projected to be mediocre in the preseason and starts the season 5-0, the market adjusts upward but often not by enough, because the preseason anchor exerts a gravitational pull. Conversely, if a team projected to be strong starts 1-4, the market adjusts downward but may anchor too heavily to the preseason projection, underweighting the early results.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>Example: Early-Season Anchoring</h4>
        <p>An NFL team is projected at 8.5 wins before the season. It starts 0-3 with an ugly point differential. By Week 4, the market has adjusted the team's power rating downward, but the preseason projection still exerts influence. The market might price the team as a true 6.5-win team when the early results suggest something closer to a 5-win team. The preseason anchor prevents the full adjustment that the data warrants. Six weeks later, when more data has accumulated, the preseason anchor fades and the market catches up to reality. But during those early weeks, the market was systematically overpricing this team relative to its actual current quality.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The opposite pattern, under-anchoring, can also produce overreaction. A team that starts 4-0 in the NFL might see its power rating surge past what four games of data should justify, especially if the wins were impressive. The market abandons the preseason anchor too quickly, overweighting the small early sample and pricing the team as if its 4-0 pace is sustainable. When the team regresses to a more modest pace, as most fast-starting teams do, the market is caught overpriced and has to correct.</p>

    <h3>The Stabilization Timeline</h3>

    <p>Research across multiple sports suggests that market pricing stabilizes at different points in the season. In the NFL, pricing reliability improves significantly after approximately four to six weeks, when enough data exists to meaningfully update preseason projections. In the NBA, the stabilization point is typically around fifteen to twenty games. In MLB, it takes roughly forty to sixty games for starting pitching peripherals and team-level batting metrics to stabilize into reliable predictive indicators.</p>

    <p>Before these stabilization points, the market is operating in a higher-uncertainty environment where overreaction to limited data is structurally inevitable. After these points, the market has enough information to price events with greater confidence, and overreaction becomes less frequent and less severe. This does not mean the market becomes perfect after stabilization. It means the baseline level of pricing noise decreases as the information environment matures.</p>

    <h2 id="self-correcting">9. The Self-Correcting Mechanism</h2>

    <p>The most important thing to understand about betting market overreactions is that they are temporary. The market has a built-in self-correcting mechanism that identifies and eliminates mispricing over time. This mechanism is not a single process but a collection of interacting forces that collectively push prices back toward true probability after an overshoot.</p>

    <h3>Informed Capital</h3>

    <p>The primary corrective force is informed capital. When a line overshoots in one direction, sophisticated bettors who have independent probability estimates recognize the mispricing and bet against it. Their bets push the line back toward fair value. The more informed capital in the market, the faster and more complete the correction. This is why overreactions persist longer in thin markets (where informed capital is scarce) than in deep markets (where it is abundant).</p>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Key Concept: Informed Capital as the Market's Immune System</h4>
        <p>Informed bettors serve a function analogous to an immune system: they identify mispricing (infections) and allocate capital (immune response) to correct it. The strength of this immune system varies by market. Deep, well-analyzed markets have strong immune systems that correct overreactions quickly. Thin, under-analyzed markets have weak immune systems where overreactions can persist.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Model Recalibration</h3>

    <p>Sportsbooks themselves correct overreactions through ongoing model recalibration. When a book's initial reaction to news produces a line that attracts imbalanced sharp action, the book recognizes that its adjustment was probably too large and recalibrates. This process is often automated: the book's risk management system detects that the new price is attracting one-directional sharp money and adjusts the line back toward the pre-news level until the sharp action equilibrates.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Book Arbitrage</h3>

    <p>When an overreaction at one sportsbook creates a price that diverges significantly from competitors, arbitrage activity helps correct the mispricing. Bettors who can place opposing positions at different books will do so, pushing the overreacting book's price back toward the market consensus. This cross-book mechanism ensures that overreactions at individual books are corrected even if that book's own customer base does not contain enough informed capital to correct the mispricing internally.</p>

    <h3>Time and Data Accumulation</h3>

    <p>The most powerful corrective force is simply time. As more games are played, more data accumulates, and the market's pricing confidence increases. Early-season overreactions to small samples are corrected as larger samples provide more reliable estimates. Narrative-driven overreactions fade as the narrative's recency diminishes and newer data takes its place. The passage of time does not guarantee correction, but it creates the conditions under which all other corrective forces can operate more effectively.</p>

    <p>The self-correcting mechanism is not instantaneous, and it is not perfect. Some overreactions persist through closing because the corrective forces were insufficient to fully offset the initial mispricing. But across thousands of events, the mechanism works: markets move toward accuracy over time, and overreactions are the exception rather than the rule. The market's ability to self-correct is, in fact, the strongest evidence that betting markets are fundamentally well-functioning information-aggregation systems, even if they are occasionally and temporarily imprecise.</p>

    <h2 id="takeaways">10. Key Takeaways</h2>

    <div class="key-concept">
        <h4>Summary: Betting Market Overreactions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overreaction means the line moved too far</strong>, not merely that it moved. Distinguishing overreaction from legitimate repricing requires an independent estimate of the true impact of the underlying event.</li>
            <li><strong>Recency bias</strong> causes markets to overweight recent results, particularly in low-frequency sports like football where each game represents a large fraction of the total sample.</li>
            <li><strong>Injury overreaction</strong> occurs because markets often price the absence of the star without adequately considering the replacement's capability, the game plan adjustment, or second-order effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Public sentiment</strong> drives prices beyond true probability when recreational betting volume is heavily one-directional, especially on primetime games involving popular teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Thin markets amplify overreaction</strong> because individual bets have outsized impact and corrective capital is scarce. Information asymmetry creates further mispricing when the market reacts to perceived sharp information that may not exist.</li>
            <li><strong>Overreaction vs. repricing</strong> is distinguished by proportionality: did the move exceed what the information warranted? Reversal patterns, information source quality, and market depth are useful heuristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Different sports produce different overreaction patterns</strong> based on sample size, game frequency, public handle concentration, and the availability of analytical data.</li>
            <li><strong>Early-season volatility</strong> is the period of maximum overreaction because limited current-season data forces the market to rely on uncertain preseason projections and amplifies the impact of each game result.</li>
            <li><strong>Markets self-correct</strong> through informed capital, model recalibration, cross-book arbitrage, and data accumulation over time. The speed and completeness of correction depends on market depth and the availability of informed participants.</li>
