            <h2>Understanding Consensus Data</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is sports betting consensus?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Sports betting consensus shows where the majority of expert handicappers are betting on a particular game. When a high percentage of professional bettors agree on one side, it creates a "consensus pick" that indicates sharp money alignment.</p>
                    <p>For example, if 75 out of 100 tracked experts pick the Chiefs to cover the spread, that's a 75% consensus on Kansas City.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How many handicappers do you track?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We track over 700 expert handicappers daily. These aren't random social media accounts - they're verified professionals competing in handicapping contests where real money is on the line. This creates accountability that filters out noise.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What consensus percentage is significant?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Generally speaking:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>50-55%</strong> - No clear edge, split opinion</li>
                        <li><strong>55-65%</strong> - Slight lean, worth monitoring</li>
                        <li><strong>65-75%</strong> - Strong consensus, significant agreement</li>
                        <li><strong>75%+</strong> - Very high consensus, rare and notable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We highlight games with 65%+ consensus as these represent meaningful agreement among experts.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Does high consensus guarantee a win?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely not. No betting system guarantees wins. High consensus simply indicates that many professional handicappers agree on a particular side. These plays tend to perform better than random selection over large sample sizes, but individual games are still unpredictable.</p>
                    <p>Think of consensus as one valuable data point, not a crystal ball.</p>

            <h2>Sharp Money & Line Movement</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is a sharp bettor?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A sharp bettor (or "sharp") is a professional gambler who consistently profits from sports betting over the long term. Sharps typically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beat the closing line regularly</li>
                        <li>Use sophisticated models and analytics</li>
                        <li>Have large bankrolls ($100K+)</li>
                        <li>Their bets move lines at sportsbooks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sportsbooks track sharp bettors closely because their action is highly informed.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is line movement?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Line movement refers to changes in betting odds from when they're first posted (opening line) to when the game starts (closing line). Lines move for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sharp money</strong> - Professional bettors betting one side</li>
                        <li><strong>Public money</strong> - Large volume of recreational bets</li>
                        <li><strong>News</strong> - Injuries, weather, lineup changes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sharp money typically causes faster, larger moves on less popular games.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does "steam move" mean?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A steam move is a sudden, significant line movement caused by large amounts of sharp money hitting a game simultaneously across multiple sportsbooks. If a team opens at -3 and quickly moves to -4.5 across the market, that's steam.</p>
                    <p>Steam moves indicate coordinated sharp action and are one of the strongest signals in sports betting.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Should I bet with or against line movement?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It depends on what's causing the movement. If sharps are moving the line, betting with the movement (on the side that's getting worse odds) means you're aligned with professional money - but you're getting worse value.</p>
                    <p>The ideal scenario is identifying sharp plays early before the line moves, getting the best number. Our consensus data helps you see where experts are betting before lines adjust.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is a point spread?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A point spread is a handicap that bookmakers apply to level the playing field between two teams. The favorite "gives" points while the underdog "gets" points.</p>
                    <p>Example: Chiefs -7 vs. Raiders +7. If you bet the Chiefs, they must win by more than 7 points. If you bet the Raiders, they can lose by up to 6 points and you still win.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What does the moneyline mean?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Moneyline odds show how much you win on a $100 bet (for positive numbers) or how much you need to bet to win $100 (for negative numbers).</p>
                    <p><strong>+150:</strong> Bet $100 to win $150 profit (underdog)</p>
                    <p><strong>-150:</strong> Bet $150 to win $100 profit (favorite)</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is the over/under (total)?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The over/under (also called the "total") is the combined score of both teams. You bet whether the actual total will be OVER or UNDER the posted number.</p>
                    <p>Example: Lakers vs. Celtics, Total 225.5. If the final score is 118-112 (230 total), the OVER wins.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is -110 juice/vig?</div>

                    <p>The -110 you see on most spread bets is called the "juice" or "vig" (vigorish). It's the sportsbook's commission. At -110, you bet $110 to win $100.</p>
                    <p>This means you need to win about 52.4% of your bets just to break even. The juice is how sportsbooks guarantee profit regardless of outcomes.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We recommend this progression:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Read our <a href="betting-guide.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Complete Betting Guide</a> to understand the basics</li>
                        <li>2. Check our <a href="covers-consensus.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Consensus Page</a> daily to see where experts are betting</li>
                        <li>3. Start with small unit sizes (1-2% of bankroll per bet)</li>
                        <li>4. Focus on one sport initially before expanding</li>
                        <li>5. Track every bet you make - you can't improve what you don't measure</li>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How much should I bet per game?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Professional bettors typically risk 1-3% of their bankroll per bet, never exceeding 5% even on their strongest plays. This protects against variance and prevents a bad streak from wiping you out.</p>
                    <p>If you have a $1,000 bankroll, that means $10-30 per bet. It might seem small, but discipline is what separates winners from losers in the long run.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Can I make a living from sports betting?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Very few people successfully bet sports professionally. It requires significant capital, extreme discipline, sophisticated analysis, and the ability to handle massive variance. Most professionals estimate only 1-3% of bettors are consistently profitable.</p>
                    <p>For the vast majority of people, sports betting should be treated as entertainment with a strict budget - not as an income source.</p>
